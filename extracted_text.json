This document\nprovides the common approach and reference solutions from leading CSPs, to serve\nthe purpose of helping CSPs develop their strategies and priorities during the\nrealization of Autonomous Network.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 10 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\n1. Introduction\nThe Telecom industry has been precise on the vision and the business and operation\ndrivers for Autonomous Networks. The market demands it, the CSPs need it, and\npreviously insurmountable technology difficulties now have feasible solutions thanks to\nAI/ML. Now is the time to focus on how to realize Autonomous Networks.\nAutonomous Networks is not just about enabling technologies nor a short-term project.\nRealizing Autonomous Networks is equivalent to constructing a brand new social-\ntechnical system inside CPS that can deliver the Autonomous Networks’ zero-x\nexperience and self-x capabilities vision. The new system will redefine all aspects of\nCSP function to become more agile, efficient, scalable, human-friendly, partner-\nfriendly, and user-friendly. Strategic planning and tactics are essential to ensure\nsuccess by balancing multiple key factors: short-term and long-term ROI, human and\nmachine coordination, swift progressing and safety, the organizational transformation\nfrom Telco to TechCo while maintaining current daily operations.\nMany CSPs have already started the Autonomous Network journey. While each CSP\nhas its priorities and strategies, there are common patterns that we can identify through\nthe lens of the Autonomous Network framework. This document specifies common\nchallenges and general approach to realizing Autonomous Networks and describes\nreference solutions that various CSPs are engaging.\nThis document (version 2.0) is based on the previous version (version 1.0) and\ncombines with the latest progress in AN implementation practice by industry partners,\nespecially CSPs. This document demonstrated the implementation of the \"four key\nelements of autonomous networks (vision and target architecture, grading standards,\nperformance indicators, operation Practice)\" as the core methodology. Gave the best\npractices of leading CSPs such as China Mobile in \"promoting self-intelligence\nnetworks on a large scale, hierarchical evaluation and self-intelligence ability\nimprovement, and construction and evaluation of effectiveness indicators\" to promote\nself-intelligence. The theoretical framework of network implementation methods is\nbecoming mature, providing method guidance and practical reference for more CSPs\nto carry out AN planning and deployment, and helping CSPs to formulate their\nstrategies and priorities during the realization of ANs.\nThis document summarizes 39 commercial solutions in 4 categories: Enable Verticals,\nCustomer Experience, Business Growth, Efficient O&M, and Green Energy. Covering\n5G to B, cloud network integration, enterprise private network/private line, high-quality\nhome broadband, DC/ All high-value business scenarios such as network energy\nconservation, covering all network majors such as transmission, IP, mobility, and\naccess, not only show the enthusiasm of the industry to develop self-smart networks,\nbut also provide the most direct reference case for CSP to carry out application\ninnovation.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Challenges of Large-scale Realization\nAs an increasing number of CSPs plan and deploy ANs, challenges are surfacing. TM\nForum’s Autonomous Networks White Paper 3.0 identified six main challenges and\noffered ideas to address them. But new problems keep emerging, so the six challenges\nhave been expanded in 2022 as follows:\n1. How to measure the business value and O&M effectiveness of ANs?\nCan L3 or L4 ANs help CSPs provide new services and expand the digital markets\nin various industries? How can L3 or L4 improve service quality and experience?\nWhat benefits can L3 or L4 offer to improve network resource usage, lower O&M\ncosts and improve O&M efficiency? These key problems need to be considered\nwhen carriers formulate AN strategies and evolution paths.\n2. How to implement a level-based autonomous closed loop and finally enable\nagile services and business closed loops?\nThe implementation of ANs requires cross-layer collaboration between networks\nand operations systems, and cross-domain streamlining of core, bearer, transport\nand wireless domains. How can CSPs develop autonomous capabilities from\nbottom to top and implement a level-based autonomous closed loop? How can\nthey quickly integrate underlying capabilities to enable agile services? How can\nthey facilitate AN construction based on business value in a top-down manner to\nachieve a business closed loop? These problems are yet to be resolved by CSPs.\n3. How to develop the L4 target profile for each network domain and set the\nevolution path?\nWhat is the L4 target profile of each network domain? What new digital services,\nbusiness models and service capabilities can be provided? What are the technical\nfeatures? What is the target architecture? What specific technical capabilities need\nto be developed? What new operations changes will emerge? What are the\nevolution paths and how to select them? These are the questions to be answered\nby CXOs of CSPs and all industry partners.\n4. How to deploy full-stack AI and leverage the collaboration between cloud-\nbased centralized AI and network-based distributed AI?\nIntroducing AI to communications networks in order to upgrade highly complex\nnetworks to ultra-intelligent systems has become the industry consensus.\nHowever, what is the target architecture for ultra-intelligent systems? Is it a\ncentralized ultra-intelligent brain that commands the entire network? Or is it an\nefficient and collaborative distributed cerebellum? How will CSPs deploy full-stack\nAI in a coordinated manner? How can they leverage the collaboration between\ncloud AI and distributed AI? The entire industry needs to jointly explore these\nquestions and find win-win answers.\n5. How to enable industry partners to collaborate and innovate, build a healthy\necosystem, and upgrade and evolve at the same time?\nThe implementation of ANs involves theoretical research and technological\nbreakthroughs in multiple sectors including communications, IT, AI and\nautomation. Many concepts and technologies are still being defined and verified.\nHow can the positioning and collaboration of all parties be standardized? How will\nthe sectors strike a balance between return on investment and developing cutting-\nedge technologies? How to design a schedule for upgrades and evolution is a\nchallenge that must be overcome.\n6. How to establish process mechanisms and develop skills for ANs?\nTremendous efforts have been made to use machines to equip employees with\nO&M capabilities and transform the troubleshooting mode from ticket forwarding,\nwhich is a long process, to device self-healing or one-hop closed-loop processing.\nHow will CSPs upgrade employees’ skills to implement automatic and intelligent\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 12 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nO&M? How will they inject O&M knowledge, train, and supervise machines in a\nlow-code manner? Answering these questions is key to the successful\nimplementation of ANs.\n7. How to establish unified evaluation standards?\nMany CSPs and suppliers have been working on the objectives of L3 and L4\nautonomous capabilities. However, due to different methods of evaluation, multiple\nevaluation scopes and varying degrees of understanding, it is difficult to compare\nand evaluate the ANL of industry players. Therefore, it becomes necessary to\njointly define unified evaluation standards.\n8. How to perform systematic planning and deployment?\nIt is challenging for CSPs to perform ANL evaluation on all products, services and\ndomains. Plus they must correlate standards at the domain level and promote\ncloud network operations autonomy for the entire network based on the unified\ngoal, planning and strategies.\n9. How to evolve capabilities efficiently?\nIt is difficult to build the mapping between ANL evaluation results and\neffectiveness evaluation results based on business and service objectives. It is\nalso challenging to effectively identify weaknesses of autonomous capabilities,\ncoordinate the autonomous capabilities of the system with those of network+cloud,\nand adopt agile iteration to evolve to the higher levels of Ans\n© TM Forum 2023.

Method: Four Key Elements to AN\nImplementation\nImplementing Autonomous Networks requires an all-around, systematic and\ncontinuous network transformation. TM Forum has aggregated industry best practices\nand summarized four elements key to AN implementation: Creating a vision and target\narchitecture Adopting the AN levels Using effectiveness indicators to measure the\nbusiness value and service effectiveness of ANs Establishing operations practices to\ndevelop automated and intelligent capabilities for networks and support systems\nefficiency. These elements are expected to help more CSPs plan and implement AN in\na faster and more systematic manner. Figure 1 illustrates how the four elements fit\ntogether, and a more detailed explanation follows.\nFigure 1: Four key elements to AN implementation\n1. Vision and target architecture – the AN vision and objectives are defined to\nimprove business growth and operations efficiency based on the overall\ncorporate strategy and industry trends (for example, business scenarios like\ncomputing power network). Based on the live network architecture and running\nstatus, key trends (for example, 5G-Advanced, cloud-network synergy and\ndigital symbiosis) are considered to develop a mid- and long-term target\narchitecture in order to guide AN construction.\n2. AN Levels – CSPs must also adopt generic ANL, domain-specific ANL and the\ncorresponding evaluation methods to fully and objectively measure the ANL.\nThe evaluation process requires setting up baselines and identifying\nweaknesses to formulate phase-specific objectives and improvement\nstrategies. Then, CSPs can launch technical research and develop innovative\napplications to meet the autonomous capability requirements at each level.\nFinally, CSPs can verify the results, optimize strategies in real time and improve\nresource utilization. 26 < Back to Contents | Method and practices for AN\nevaluation\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 14 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\n3. Effectiveness indicators – it is important to measure the business value and\nservice effectiveness of AN in terms of service growth, customer experience\nand operations efficiency. The value of these indicators lies in two aspects: 1)\nvisualizing and quantifying the effectiveness and benefits of AN evolution and\n2) aligning the development of autonomous capabilities with the enterprise\nstrategy and service development trend. Effectiveness indicators are selected\nbased on the Zero-X and Self-X visions. Effectiveness indicators and ANL are\ntwo key AN evaluation factors that jointly facilitate the fulfillment of the AN\nvision.\n4. Operations practices – improving autonomous capabilities for networks and\noperations systems is also key. From the network (including NE) perspective,\nthe focus is on improving converged sensing, self-configuration and native\nintelligence. From the operations system perspective, the focus is on improving\nrequirement translation, end-to-end resource orchestration and cross-domain\nO&M optimization. In order to accelerate large-scale AN deployment, the\nindustry has summarized a five-step operations practice method for reference:\na. AN implementation planning;\nb. ANL evaluation/weakness identification;\nc. strategy and direction selection;\nd. application innovation/pilot project verification; and\ne. capability development/application promotion.\nOrganizational capabilities and industry evaluation Organizational capabilities are also\na crucial factor for AN implementation. The network operations department, including\nthe corporate culture (system), organizational structure, work processes and skills,\nneed to be adjusted or optimized to adapt to the construction of ANs. Then industry\nevaluation and certification can verify the result of AN implementation.\nIndustry organizations or authorities need to provide an evaluation environment and\nlaunch ANL evaluation and certification based on unified standards. Authoritative\nevaluation and certification increase credibility, help CSPs better serve industry\ncustomers and promote win-win industry development. Unified evaluation standards\ncan help carriers improve network and service capabilities and provide customers with\na Zero-X service experience. A well-founded evaluation environment facilitates\ninnovation and verification of technologies and applications, cross-vendor\ncollaboration, and end-to-end streamlining of business processes. The following\nsections provide several best practices to help readers better understand the four\nelements key to AN implementation, evaluation and certification.\n3.2. Practices of AN Level (ANL) Evaluation\n3.2.1. China Mobile’s ANL Practice\nFirst company to target L4 at scale for production by 2025\nAs the first CSP in the industry to propose the goal of reaching L4 by 2025 and\ndeploying large-scale practice, China Mobile has proposed the target architecture and\nspecific vision of “zero-waiting, zero-failure and zero-contact”, together with “self-\nconfiguration, self-healing and self-optimization”. The company’s target architecture is\nshown on the next page.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 15 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nFigure 2: China Mobile’s target architecture\nFirst systematic level evaluation methodology and practice\nTechnical assessment covering the full lifecycle – China Mobile has built and practiced\nthe first systematic evaluation system in the industry, including six workflow domains:\nnetwork planning, deployment, maintenance, optimization, operation and inventory\nmanagement.\nThirty-seven types of core capabilities are continuously sorted out and improved\naround customer response and network quality. Based on the 3D model of “operation\nworkflow-network domain-service domain”, 298 sub-tasks are further sorted out in five\nmajor network domains and three categories with 12 key services provided. The scope\nof sub-tasks is defined in detail and enriched into 1,328 task context/scenarios to lead\n31 provincial companies to apply digital intelligent capabilities closely around the\nrequirements of various domains and services.\nChina Mobile has defined a maturity model as shown in Table 1 to guide the system\nimplementation. It refers to the DIKW (data, information, knowledge, wisdom) system\nand aims at the step-by-step construction of system cognitive ability.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

After\ntechnical assessment of each scenario, the average score of all scenarios included in\neach task is calculated as the level of this task. The level of the evaluated network is\nthe average score of all the tasks defined by it.\nContinuous improvement – combined with the effectiveness indicators, weakness of\nthe system is determined according to the technical assessment result. As each task\nclearly corresponds to a management responsibility subject/department, the\ndepartment is responsible for the continuous improvement and subsequent\nenhancement of this task. Through continuous construction and improvement of\nautonomy of network elements, the operations and maintenance center (OMC) and\nnetwork management systems, the digital intelligent transformation and upgrading of\nthose tasks is realized in a closed-loop manner.\n3.2.2. China Telecom’s Practice: AN Characteristics Across ANL\nChina Telecom accelerates the construction of cloud-network operation autonomy;\nfocuses on closed-loop operations; faces customers, partners, products, and network +\ncloud; matches the development stage of cloud-network integration; and defines the\nintergenerational characteristics of cloud-network operation self-intelligence. The\ncompany is defining these characteristics across ANL as shown in Figure 3.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

China Unicom’s Practice: ANL Evaluation\nIn the process of practicing AN, China Unicom met some challenges such as how to\npractice ANL improvement, enhance cross-layers and cross-domain collaboration, and\ndevelop a clear evolution path. To solve these challenges, the company has created a\nsystematic top-level design which took “AN level evaluation, capability building and\nvalue verification” as key actions.\n• ANL evaluation – to measure the current status of AN capabilities, China\nUnicom defined an ANL that consisted of two parts:\n• Generic ANL: as a framework, the generic ANL was used to unify the\ncharacteristics of each level and evolution direction of the AN. China Unicom\nbroke it down into five operation flows and 43 operation tasks and defined\ngeneric levels for every operation task.\n• Domain-specific ANL: the function of domain-specific ANL was to make the\nlevel feasible and implementable and to guide the AN capability development\nfor network and service domains. China Unicom developed domain specific\nANL by focusing on key network and service domains and combining the\nspecial characteristics of different domains. Currently, domain-specific for\nwireless and transmission network, 2H and 2B services have been developed.\nTable 2 shows the L4 ANL criteria of task “Network optimization - Performance\ndeterioration prediction” as an example.\nTable 2: L4 ANL example\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 18 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\n• Capability development – to promote specific domain AN capability planning\nand development, China Unicom formed the “capability map” for each domain.\nAN capabilities were split into network layer, platform layer and application layer\nbased on domain ANL criteria.\n• Value verification – to evaluate and verify the effects of AN evolution, China\nUnicom set up the AN effectiveness indicator based on the goal of customer-\noriented agile service and network intelligent operation.\nChina Unicom is conducting network-wide AN practice based on domain-specific AN\nlevel criterion, generating the AN capability map, and evaluating the effect and value of\nthe AN implementation for the achievement of the AN objectives.\n3.2.4. MTN’s Practice: Define the Domain-Specific ANL and Evaluate per\nSub-scenario\nMTN Group aims to have accurate evaluation of ANL for each network per technology\ndomain and guide its operating companies to be innovative from a technology-specific\nperspective. Based on the generic ANL criteria defined in 2021, MTN defined domain\nspecific ANL criteria for 43 operation tasks per technology domain. In 2022, MTN\nestablished two work streams: defining domain-specific criteria and evaluating per sub-\nscenario in the technical domain.\n1. Define the domain specific ANL criterial\nTable 3: Transmission network operation task example\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\n1. Evaluate per sub-scenario in technical domain. Live network scenarios for\neach task in the specified technology domain are listed clearly, and\ndomain-specified ANL criteria are used to evaluate per sub-scenario.\nTable 4: Sub-scenario list example\n3.3. Practices of AN Effectiveness Indicators\n3.3.1. China Mobile’s Practice for Effectiveness Indicators\nBased on the TM Forum Metrics Framework (GB935), and the positioning and value of\neffectiveness indicators, China Mobile recommends a top-down method for developing\neffectiveness indicators. This method includes three steps:\n• Step 1: Develop an effectiveness indicator framework based on user value and\nO&M value.\nThere are generic and detailed indicators. Generic indicators measure the general\nautomation and intelligence level of the entire network. Detailed indicators are domain-\nand service-specific indicators. The principles for selecting the indicators are highly\nrelevant to AN and have the following objectives:\n• User value indicators are designed to fulfill the Zero-X vision and improve the\nexperience of users including industry customers, individual consumers, and\npartners. For example, zero-wait (average service provisioning duration), zero-\ntouch (user self-service rate) and zero trouble (service availability).\n• O&M value indicators are designed to fulfill the Self-X vision and reduce\nnetwork O&M costs and improve O&M efficiency such as self-configuration\n(automatic configuration rate), self-healing (proportion of preventive and\npredictive O&M tickets) and self-optimizing (energy efficiency improvement\nrate).\n• Step 2: List effectiveness indicators based on the service development and\nnetwork maintenance objectives.\nChina Mobile selects the core capability automation rate as a generic indicator, which\nmeasures the proportion of L2 core capabilities. In addition, 24 detailed indicators and\nan indicator model are defined. Table 5 provides an example:\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 20 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nTable 5: China Mobile’s effectiveness indicator example\n• Step 3: Define phase-specific targets and different types of views to apply the\neffectiveness indicators and launch related practices.\nBased on the effectiveness indicator list, develop and deploy corresponding IT\nsystems. Define effectiveness indicator baselines based on the status quo. Set phase-\nspecific targets (which can be continuously optimized). Table 6 provides an example.\nTable 6: China Mobile’s effectiveness indicator target example\nThe evaluation results of effectiveness indicators can be used in multiple scenarios.\nFor example, the management view can be used to visualize the status and trend of\nthe indicators. The production view can be used to identify capability weaknesses in\norder to better develop and improve AN capabilities.\n3.3.2. China Telecom’s Practice for Effectiveness Indicators\nTo measure the business value of cloud network operations autonomy, China Telecom\ndefines the effectiveness evaluation standard framework, which includes ultra-premium\ncustomer experience, ultra-fast telecom services and ultra-intelligent cloud network\noperations. This framework, shown in Figure 4, can evaluate the contribution of\nimproving the autonomous level to product services, customer experience and\noperations efficiency.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Page 21 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nFigure 4: China Telecom’s evaluation framework\nChina Telecom maps the operations phase and products used in this phase with the\neffectiveness evaluation standard framework and breaks down the end-to-end\nindicators for cloud-network convergence products into system and professional\nnetwork indicators. The name, formulas and data sources of each indicator are\ndefined. The indicator baselines and the year-by-year improvement goals (absolute\nvalues) for the next three years are also defined based on live network data analysis.\nThese indicators will drive the development of autonomous capabilities and level\nevolution. Table 5 on the next page describes some of the indicators and targets.\nTable 7: China Telecom’s effectiveness indicator targets example\n3.4. Operation Practice\n3.4.1. The First Large-scale AN Operation Practice in China Mobile\nChina Mobile’s AN operation follows the closed-loop method of “industrial standard\npromotion, top-level design, digital intelligent capability building and application,\nevaluation and analysis”, and systematically promotes the capability improvement and\nautonomous evolution of the whole network. Figure 5 shows the process.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 22 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nFigure 5: China Mobile’s closed-loop method\n• Industrial standard promotion – China Mobile has been actively contributing\nto the industry standards and guide all parties in collaborative deployment.\nPractices are summarized and shared as multiple TM Forum assets to promote\nshared growth.\n• Top-level design – China Mobile has put forward the target architecture of “2\nobjectives, 3 layers and 4 closed loops”. Thirty-seven key capabilities have\nbeen defined, covering the full lifecycle of network operation. Autonomy\nevaluation has been evaluated from both the technical side and application side\nto better reveal the deployment effect of autonomous network.\n• Digital intelligent capability building and application – vendors are guided\nto improve built-in automation and intelligence of network elements, centralized\ndata acquisition and control of OMC. The company continuously optimizes the\nOAM process, rules and policies, and data model to improve single-domain\nautonomy and cross-domain collaboration, vigorously promoting AI innovation.\n• Evaluation and analysis – 31 provincial branches are organized together to\ncarry out capability evaluation around key domains and services. The best\ninnovative products are selected and deployed on the whole network. Through\nthe evaluation, shortcomings are identified, and improvement plans are\nformulated to promote future ANL enhancement.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

China Mobile: Eastern Data and Western Computing Force\nEastern China has a developed economy and therefore demands a large amount of\ncomputing power, but it faces tight restrictions around energy consumption and high\nelectricity costs. On the contrary, western China is rich in clean energy and has a\nwealth of data centers (DCs). Western China adopts cost-effective, single-bit\ntechnology to store and process data, but computing demands in this region are quite\nlow. This is causing companies to look at how to better promote the complementary\nadvantages of the developed economy in the east and the abundant renewable energy\nin the west to solve the challenge of maximizing the efficiency of clean energy in the\ncountry.\nSolution\nChina Mobile gives full play to the resource advantages of the whole network,\ncomprehensively promoting the capability improvement of the Autonomous Network.\nThrough construction of its Jiutian AI platform, the company is building a nationwide,\nnon-real-time computing power support base to achieve eastern data trained in\nwestern China. Figure 6 shows how it works.\nFigure 6: China Mobile’s Jiutian AI platform supports energy optimization\nThe platform consists of two layers: centralized node and distributed edge node. The\ncentralized node provides centralized AI training ability and shared platform resource.\nWhen data is generated in fulfilling business demand in the east, the system transmits\nthe data to the western hub and completes the unified training in the Internet data\ncenter (IDC) located in the west using the abundant clean energy. After the training is\ncompleted, the AI model is sent back to the east, and the local edge nodes close to the\nuser in the east complete real-time inference and decision-making to effectively\nimprove the energy efficiency of overall IT resources.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 24 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nApplication and benefits\nThe AI ability of “eastern data trained in the west” has already been applied in many\nscenarios, including wireless base station energy saving, IDC energy saving, intelligent\ninspection, cross-layer fault location in the 5G core, network traffic prediction, etc.\nChina Mobile continues to build AI centralized training and inference capability and\nprovides Self-X operation capabilities such as “AI centralized self-training, self-\nanalysis” to provide customers with Zero-X experience.\nCollaborating with China Unitech and Huawei, this solution has been piloted in China\nMobile Zhejiang and Shaanxi. In terms of AI training and inference, by building a\ncentralized AI platform the utilization rate of IT resources is greatly improved. The AI\ntraining server, storage space and power resources are saved. The carbon emissions\nare reduced by 30%, and the overall efficiency is optimized.\n4.1.2. China Telecom & MTN : Cloud-Network Convergence\nSince 2020, global enterprises have accelerated their business migration to the cloud,\nand gradually moved their key information systems and core production systems to the\ncloud.\nCloud-network convergence is a network architecture reform and network capability\nupgrade which is driven by business requirements and technological innovation. It is a\nconcept that CSPs put forward which aims to take advantage of their infrastructure\nsuch as \"wide area network, large-scale DC, and territorial services\" and provide end\ncustomers with cloud-network convergent business and services.\nBusiness scenarios Customer expectation Cause analysis of the\ngap\nSmart Service • Access to the cloud anytime,\noperation of provisioning anywhere.

All Rights Reserved. Page 26 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nFigure 7: Intelligent Cloud-network convergence business solution\nChina Telecom: Smart operation of cloud-network convergence\nCloud-network convergence has become a top priority for many governments and\nenterprises when they migrate to the cloud. However, in production scenarios such as\n\"service provisioning, quality management, and fault management\", there are still\nproblems such as \"inconvenient ordering, long provisioning cycles, inconsistent cloud\nand network experience, difficult end-to-end SLA guarantees, and slow service\nrepair/fault handling\", which is still far from the expectations of customers.\nThe cloud-network convergence smart operation solution adopts the architecture and\nconcept of \"network moving with the cloud and cloud-network integration\", It introduces\n\"SRv6, flow detection, AI and cloud-network intelligence and other ICT technologies\nand cloud-network operating systems to comprehensively improve multiple automation\nand intelligence capabilities such as “real-time self-awareness of cloud-network\nresource topology and status, unified and self-organized resources, self-generated\nSLA policies, self-configured service activation, self-organizing, self-guarantee, self-\nhealing and self-optimization of service quality and cloud-network failure”. The\nbusiness scenarios below show which autonomous network capabilities are used:\n• Service provisioning: The business operation layer provides industry templates\nfor government and enterprise customers. It can take customers’ orders and\nchange cloud-network services in one-stop and on-demand. It integrates\ncustomer requirements for \"SLA and cost\", automatically generates SLA\nstrategies and drives service and resource operation layers for configuration.\nThe service operation layer is based on the cloud-network unified operation\nsupport system, integrates the capabilities of each segment of business\nactivation, and self-organizing cloud and network resources in a unified manner\nto achieve customer-oriented one-click activation. Finally, the resource\noperation layer deploys cloud-network points of presence (PoPs) to support\nusers to enter the cloud quickly and from any location. The resource layer\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 27 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nopens the underlying capabilities to realize the automatic configuration of\nVPNs, tunnels, slices, etc., to support the rapid opening of services.\n• Quality Management: Service quality and customer experience drive the single-\ndomain autonomy and cross-layer link in the closed-loop of the service and\nresource operation layer. The business operation layer provides cloud and\nnetwork business visualized self-management clients for government and\nenterprise customers. These enable internal operation and maintenance, and\nthey build a comprehensive view of cloud and network information, supporting\nintelligent marketing, agile activation, and cross-domain collaborative operation\nand maintenance. The service operation layer collects the resource status and\nservice quality information of each segment of the network (autonomous\ndomain) in real time, visually presents the service SLA situation, realizes end-\nto-end SLA analysis and prediction and self-guarantee. It also automatically\ngenerates self-healing or self-optimization strategies. According to the service\nrequirements, the operation layer can sense, analyze, and report the quality of\neach segment of the network in real time based on technologies such as\ntelemetry and flow detection, and realize self-healing or self-optimization of the\nnetwork based on SRv6 technology.\n• Fault Management: The Service operation layer provides mapping relationships\nbetween the business and the network, aggregates the cloud and network\nservice information of each segment and triggers the service fault recovery\nintent. The Resource layer translates the intent through the cloud and network\nresource orchestration and scheduling with zero interruption. Each autonomous\ndomain of the resource operation layer automatically reports alarms/faults and\ncompletes self-healing actions such as resetting and restarting for rapid fault\nrecovery.\nFor high-level autonomy capabilities, the \"intent resolution module\" is developed to\nbuild general intent resolutions and reverse translation capabilities to provide capability\nsupport for the three operation layers to achieve 4 intent based closed loops.\nThe cloud-network integrated agile opening and smart operation solution adopts a\nunified planning, single-domain autonomy first and then cross-domain collaboration for\npilot verification and production network deployment. At present, large-scale\ndeployments of the three scenarios of \"service provisioning, 5G service quality\nmanagement, and fault management\" has been achieved, with the following results:\n• No waiting, hour-level service provisioning: 5G slice configuration and number\nsigning are automatically activated throughout the entire process, which has\nbeen implemented in more than 30 customer projects in the four provinces of\nBeijing, Guangdong, Jiangsu and Zhejiang. The entire process of product\ndeployment and launch, from order acceptance to opening is automated.\nProduct loading has been upgraded from monthly/weekly to hourly level, saving\nmore than 20 man-days per project on average. The autonomous network level\nhas been upgraded from L2.1 to L3.0.\n• Differentiated, end-to-end SLA guarantee: Through 5G full-service intelligent\nperception and diagnosis capabilities, it can realize linkage alarm dispatch and\nend-to-end self-closed loop. At present, the first-level system has been\ndeployed in China Telecom's 31 provincial subnets, and it has begun to run,\nanalyze and process data from 31 provinces, and carry out SLA monitoring and\nassurance. The autonomous network level has been upgraded from L1.9 to\nL2.7.\n• Zero-failure, minute-level business recovery: AI automatic identification of\ncloud-network hidden dangers have been deployed in China Telecom’s 29\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 28 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nprovincial subnets, realizing hidden risks minute-level discovery, business\nminute-level recovery and fault hour-level processing. The failure automatic\nprocessing rate reached 40%, the major incident business automatic recovery\nrate was 60%, and the processing efficiency increased by 85%. The\nautonomous network level has been upgraded from L1 to L2.\nMTN: Cloud Private Line Convergence\nCloud Private Line convergence needs to be established to support online self-service\nfor subscribers, supporting network slicing, guaranteeing differentiated SLA, and\nsupporting zero-X operational experience. However, gaps still exist due to complex\nprotocols, complex cloud network configurations, lack of service visibilities, and\noperational difficulties in fault detection and analysis. To successfully implement cloud-\nprivate line convergence, automation and autonomy are required to guarantee\nnetwork readiness and augment operation services.\nThe 3-layers with 4-closed loops framework of figure 19 above is applied in the\nlifecycle of cloud-private line convergent process as detailed below:\n• Resource layer closed-loop: hierarchical slice based private network is\nconstructed with SRv6+EVPN, programmable and self-optimizing paths, and\ntelemetry-based SLA real time awareness and visualization per\nservice. Network service API interface is enabled to the upper OSS layer for a\nfast service request.\n• Service layer closed-loop: Operation service efficiency is improved with zero-X\nservice experience, with self-X capabilities. For example, service fault recovery\ncan be performed with zero-interruptions through complex, cross domain fault\ndemarcation and analysis, which drive self-optimizing and self-healing at the\nresource layer. The status of the recovery will be reported back to the service\nlayer for smart operation and maintenance.\n• Business layer closed-loop: This layer is enabled with one-click fast scheduling,\none-hop to the cloud, and one-network wide connection business service\ncapabilities. Business intent is driven at the upper business layer and interacts\nwith the lower service and resource layer with open APIs. This drives efficient\nscheduling of cloud-network resources with AI algorithms, establishes cloud\naccess paths across domains and minute-level multi-cloud access to construct\na hierarchical slice based private network providing guaranteed differentiated\nservices for high value customers.\nChina Mobile: Automatic Provisioning of Cloud Network Services towards\nEnterprise customers\nTraditional cloud-networking service provisioning is performed manually, and it involves\nmultiple different steps, including service analysis, resource survey, command\ncompiling, verification and testing. End-to-end service provisioning usually takes\nseveral days.\nChina Mobile has developed an IP Maintenance Platform, where AN capabilities are\nimplemented to significantly improve service provisioning efficiency in combination with\ncontainerized and micro-service architecture. Using the 3-layer AN framework, the\ndetailed technical path is as follows:\n• Real-time network awareness: The resource operation layer provides real-time\ncollection of network status and performance in each autonomous domain with\nseveral protocols, such as simple network management protocol (SNMP),\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 29 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\ncommand-line interface (CLI), NetFlow, telemetry, and two-way active\nmanagement protocol (TWAMP). The service operation layer makes a high-\nlevel end-to-end analysis of autonomous domains.\n• Zero-touch service provisioning: Based on the overall real-time status of\nnetwork, the service operation layer dynamically calculates the optimal path\nand executes automatic configuration. AI-powered network path calculation is\nadopted to get the result within only a few seconds. The resource operation\nlayer provides dynamic and accurate resource allocation for service\nprovisioning.\n• Self-managing enables high-efficient agile deployment: The resource operation\nlayer provides atomic abilities with Netconf (a high-efficient & complete-\ntransaction protocol). Common capabilities can be quickly developed on\ndemand and be shared and reused in multiple cases. The service operation\nlayer assembles these capabilities to achieve a service-oriented ability for the\nbusiness operation layer to invoke.\nThe IP Maintenance Platform enables AN features such as zero-touch, and zero-wait\nto the end-to-end process from service subscription to service provisioning, reducing\nthe total time of fulfilling cloud-networking services to only a few minutes. This\nimproves customer satisfaction and increases the autonomous network level of China\nMobile from L1 to L3.\n4.1.3. Flexible Computing Network Scheduling\nGlobal enterprises are accelerating the process of cloud access. Carriers are looking to\nleverage their advantageous networks and computing power to streamline computing\npower in the society, centrally and flexibly schedule computing power from different\nsources, and provide enterprises with more convenient, secure, and reliable cloud\naccess experience. However, the scale and direction of enterprises' digital traffic are\nuncertain. Around 30% of traffic needs to be scheduled across different provinces on\nthe entire network, creating daunting challenges to carrier network coverage,\ntimeliness of on-demand provisioning, and flexibility of network-wide scheduling.\nCollaborative cloud-network development needs to be accelerated to promote cloud-\nnetwork integrated O&M.\n• Rapid coverage of transport capacity: Carriers quickly deploy quality\nnetworks for enterprises in order to support digital transformation of enterprise\nservices.\n• Quick acquisition of transport capacity: Optimal network paths are\nrecommended based on enterprise intents, such as latency SLA, computing\nresources, and traffic calendar.\n• Transport-computing power collaboration: Cloud access circuits and inter-\ncloud interconnection circuits can be deployed or removed on demand within a\nfew seconds, adapting to traffic changes and elastic bandwidth, and allowing\nenterprise applications to flexibly obtain computing power.\nThe flexible computing network scheduling solution focuses on deploying basic\ntransport capacity for carriers' all-optical networks. The capabilities to self-sense and\nself-configure transport capacity are implemented to quickly develop resources for wide\ncoverage computing networks and access premium cloud connections in one hop.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 30 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nNetwork self-sensing: Real-time seconds-level or milliseconds-level sensing is\nimplemented across the entire network, between clouds, and on cloud access\nconnections. The network latency, bandwidth, and usage, as well as the usage of top N\ncloud pool resources and other information can be perceived and visualized on the GIS\nmap.\n• Inter-cloud transport capacity matrix: From the computing power perspective,\nclearly displays network information (including latency, bandwidth, and usage)\nof interconnected computing resource pools after self-owned and social\ncomputing power are applied to the network.\n• Latency circle for cloud access transport capacity: From the enterprise\nperspective, renders the latency circle (1 ms - 5 ms - 20 ms) for quality\ntransport capacity in order to identify the distribution of computing power\navailable to enterprises.\nNetwork self-configuring: The transport capacity of each cloud pool on the entire\nnetwork is displayed from enterprise perspective to facilitate the deployment of high-\nquality networks with low latency and elastic bandwidth. Quality cloud access paths are\nintelligently recommended based on the SLA (latency, bandwidth, and availability) of\nenterprise cloud access. Cloud access paths for millions of NEs can be scheduled and\ndeployed within just a few seconds, implementing on-demand elastic scaling of\nnetwork connections (deployment and removal).\nChina Unicom Guangdong and Huawei are the first to jointly deploy this innovative\nsolution to select paths based on service requirements and perform elastic scaling of\ncloud access connections during peak hours, improving SLA assurance. This solution\nhelps China Unicom quickly achieve 100% coverage of high-quality transport capacity\nand deploy a service ecosystem.\nFigure 8: Flexible Computing Network Scheduling\n© TM Forum 2023.

Enabling Verticals Autonomous Networks Hyperloops Enabling\nSmart-X Industries – Smart Tourism/Stadium\nWith the Covid-19 pandemic impacting business and daily life in so many ways, just\nimagine the new “disruptive” services that will emerge. They will be completely\nautonomous, designed for zero-touch and zero-fault operations and autoscaling based\non experience expectations. This use case from a recent TM Forum Catalyst\nchampioned by five CSPs from around the world looks at how AN can help this new\nnormal for the on-site and on-premises hybrid environment.\nTelecoms and industry verticals focus on both “operational efficiency” and “business\ngrowth”, providing agile business and support models to maintain or enforce resiliency\nin unforeseen crises and get new revenue even during tough periods. To address this\nnew normal, service providers need to realize autonomous ICT services with\nautonomous digital enabling services, while simultaneously solving the challenges of\ncross-domain/cross-vertical and hybrid networks for innovative new services.\nIn phase three, the smart tourism/stadium Catalyst is scoped as a key entry point for\nAN services in a digital marketplace. This includes both global experiences as a citizen\non-site and remote viewing of matches on-premises as a part of the citizen journey\nthrough on-demand AN (including zero-touch operations, closed loops and business\nintent).\nIn the demonstration, a tourist visiting a place (either real or virtual) needs a seamless\nexperience based on their preferences. The needs could be mostly dynamic and at that\nmoment have to be served without any complexity, which might cause an\nunpredictable surge in demand on infrastructure, and this surge might require manual\noperation. Deploying massive, dedicated networks dynamically and flexibly, while\nensuring sustainability and efficiency becomes a big challenge.\nFigure 9: Examples of vertical use cases that benefit from ANs\nSmart tourism and stadium services are trending use cases where ANs are key for\nCSPs to deploy smart solutions and services that can enrich a fan’s experience and\nsafety and increase the CSP’s profitability by providing value-added services\ndynamically. These solutions will require the connection of many IoT and mobile\ndevices that are densely populated within a stipulated area gathering lots of information\nsuch as location, footfall, trending demand, etc.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 32 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nOne of the key questions CSPs are exploring is how they can improve fans’ experience\nwith autonomous drones and cameras to enrich game experiences and extend live-like\nexperiences even in cases when fans are not allowed to be in the stadium. The drones\nand cameras will be connected to a wireless access network, and they will keep\ncapturing the game at various views and positions, streaming live video feeds to the\nfans via an app on their smartphone or VR headsets. Connectivity solutions like private\n5G can deliver massive bandwidth and meet demands for very low latency. Machine\nlearning and AI will use the information from image and video analytics to provide the\nbest fan experience – tracking their favorite player, for example. AI can also enhance\nsafety – by quickly detecting fights or brawls that may break out, for example – and\nrecommending immediate actions.\nThe Catalyst is described in more detail on the next pages, considering 1) architecture;\n2) enabling smart stadiums and self-service fulfillment; 3) intent-based operations; and\n4) scalability and efficiency.\n1. Solution architecture powering ANs\nTo achieve ANs for vertical use cases, maturity is required across several loops\nincluding resource, service, business and user. The simplified architecture to achieve\nthis maturity is shown in Figure 10, followed by an explanation of each level of\noperations.\nFigure 10: Simplified solution architecture of Ans\n• Business operations (BO) – this layer presents business rules and business\nintent for self-planning and self-marketing (e.g., self-ordering, including\nautonomous order-to activation) to facilitate zero-friction products for users.\n• Service operations (SO) – this layer represents autonomous service lifecycle\nmanagement comprising self-ordering, self-organizing, self-managing and self-\nassuring.

While governance and monitoring can be executed in advance and in hindsight,\ndefining business limits is an activity that needs to be executed in near real time.\nRepair and scale activity provided in autonomous operations is a huge benefit, but\nmeasures must be in place to avoid activity that is against the CSP’s or customer’s\nbusiness interests. This is playing out differently in B2B and in B2C scenarios.\nFor the observance and execution of these business limits as budget caps or spending\nlimits, new capabilities are needed in business support system (BSS) components. A\nbusiness process within the business/service/resource closed loop needs to execute\nthe checks, and a proposed “budget limit” or “business limit” API needs to be available\nto check against the defined boundaries on the CSP and customer side.\n1. Enabling smart stadium/tourism\nCSPs can monetize the smart stadium/tourism use case to empower stadiums and\nsports clubs and to enrich fans’ experience with experience and safety. They can also\nenable constant time-efficient management of stadiums by leveraging Zero-X\nexperiences based on the AN business and technical architecture across the layers\nincluding edge cameras and drones, video capability, edge containers, virtualization,\nautomated to autonomous operations, AI and insights analytics, and 5G. The reference\narchitecture to achieve AN for smart stadiums or tourism is depicted in Figure 11.\nFigure 11: Smart stadium use case\nFor example, a tourist visiting Paris for the Olympic Games would like to have\naugmented maps to guide them through public transportation and to get dynamic fan\nexperiences at the venue or stadium. This is an example of autonomous tourist/fan\nexperience and safety.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 34 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nThe smart stadium scenarios described above aim to demonstrate autonomous\nbehavior across all loops (explained further in the next section) with the 5G network as\nthe connectivity backbone and video analytics capabilities at the edge. Autonomous\nself-service fulfillment is depicted in Figure 9 as an example of usage of AN\ncapabilities. More details can be found in this Catalyst white paper.\nAutonomous self-service fulfillment\nOne of the key elements of providing seamless autonomous services to fans is zero-\nfriction service fulfillment. It’s a leapfrog transformation in terms of quality of service\nfrom manual and time-consuming workflows to autonomous self-ordering and self-\nmanaged networks. Autonomous self-service fulfillment workflow aims at seamless\nexperience in services extended to fans and optimizing total cost of ownership for the\nservice provider in managing the stadiums.\nKey elements of the autonomous workflow depicted in the figure aim to deliver zero-\nfriction services to fans:\n• User intent management\n• Service and resource usage requirements (QoS/QoE/SLA)\n• Zero-touch service provisioning and onboarding\n• Autonomous service delivery\n• Dynamic resource scale in/out and optimization Closed-loop remediation with\nintent\n• Budget limit-based service delivery\nFigure 12: Self-ordering\n1. Intent translation and decomposition study\nService providers and end customers (users) have varied demands for services over a\nnetwork. While meeting end users’ demands, service providers want to minimize the\namount of data that is transmitted to reduce operating costs and respond quickly to\nmaintain user satisfaction. These demands are defined as intents (see Section 3), and\nthe aim is to enable service operation on the basis of them. (We’ll look at some\nadditional intent use cases in Section 5.2.)\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 35 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nFigure 13 shows the technologies for achieving intent-based operation. Intents are not\nalways given as specific requirements by users. For example, ambiguous demands for\nfunctional requirements, such as “enjoying watching sports”, or ambiguous demands\nwith no index or value for the quality or performance of certain functions, such as\n“feeling of being there” can be assumed.\nFigure 13: Fundamental technologies of intent-based operation\nTo apply these ambiguous intents in service operation, the team needs to break them\ndown and define a set of requirements (intent definition) – see Figure 14. To express\nquantitative values of non-functional requirements related to quality or performance,\nthe Catalyst is studying the definition of general indices for various intents and\nquantitative values for each index.\nFigure 14: Intent definition\n© TM Forum 2023.

Page 36 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nIntent-extraction technology\nThis technology collects information related to users’ intents and extracts a set of\nspecific requirements. Intent-related information is 1) language information through the\ninput interface for users and 2) information obtained in-service related to these users.\nThe Catalyst aims to extract a set of specific requirements that users have by using\nvarious types of information.\nResource-requirement-conversion technology\nSpecific requirements extracted with intent-extraction technology need to be converted\ninto indicators that can be controlled by the resource controller. A two-step function, 1)\nquantitative intent -> high/low-level intent 2) high/low-level intent -> configuration, is\nrequired. The technology to achieve quantitative intent can be developed not only by\nconventional machine learning, but also by the hierarchical KPI structure and\nimplications of KPIs for intents.\nImplementation architecture of AN hyperloops\nBy combining Self-X capabilities with intent study, the Catalyst is exploring much new\nground, and new component areas need to be introduced in reference to AN reference\narchitecture. Intent extraction as part of knowledge and intelligence plays a major role\nin during the journey to usable intent-driven orchestration (see Figure 15).\nFigure 15: Implementation architecture\n1. Scalability and elasticity with energy efficiency\nThe Covid-19 crisis is accelerating digital transformation across industries.\nDigitalization dramatically changes customer behavior. Driven by the new demand for\ncontactless self-service ordering, many companies have seen on-demand services as\na critical priority for the upcoming years, and continuously automate processes to\nimprove efficiency, respond to fast-changing customers’ needs and so on.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Page 37 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nUsing AI to make energy use more efficient\nThe change in energy consumption over time brings time series data that can be used\nto understand patterns and predict future patterns. Machine learning can be used to\nachieve the best energy efficiency and AI can be used for solving the time series\nforecasting problem. In the implementation, various data such as configuration,\nnetwork traffic and performance indicators can be collected from the live network. Deep\nlearning can further predict future network traffic and energy utilization. Based on AI\nprediction, some interfaces and functions of the device can be turned off without\naffecting the service experience to achieve the purpose of energy saving.\nOn-demand self-service networks make eco easy\nNetwork-on-demand not only provides business agility, but also cost-effective energy\nefficiency. ANs keep network services performing smoothly and fulfill the SLA target.\nMoreover, the Catalyst introduces the capability to dynamically onboard network\nfunctions depending on the specific connectivity requirements whenever needed and to\npromptly eliminate those functions once the requirements are fulfilled, so as not to\nconsume more energy.\n4.1.5. Autonomous Networks Hyper Loops for disruptive digital services\nPhase II - Smart Agriculture\nNew, disruptive and innovative digital services that are completely autonomous and\ndesigned for zero-touch and zero-fault operations could revolutionize the future of how\nwe do business and interact with society. These new digital services offer a great\nopportunity for service providers to increase their revenue through new services they\ncan offer to their customers. To be able to offer many of these digital services such as\nsmart industry, cities or health, CSPs need to automate their operations and gain\nefficiencies so that they can be delivered at a cost point the market requires.\nAutonomous Networks with zero-wait, zero-touch and zero-trouble capabilities\nempower CSPs to monetize & support the diverse set of vertical use case\nrequirements. Once Autonomous Networks are in place service providers, B2C\ncustomers, digital service providers (DSPs) and telecom service providers will benefit\nfrom better, seamless experiences and improved operational efficiencies. In addition,\nthe end-to-end lifecycle complexity will be hidden away from the user and self-\nassurance will be inbuilt.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 38 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nFigure 16: Examples of vertical use cases that benefit from Autonomous Networks\nFrom the vertical examples listed above, smart agriculture is a paradigmatic use case\nwhere Autonomous Networks are key for CSPs to deploy smart agriculture solutions\nand services that can help farmers become more efficient and increase their\nprofitability by managing crops and livestock in real-time. These solutions will require\nthe connection of many IoT devices spread over large and complex areas gathering\nlots of information such as tractor location, weather forecasts, soil moisture levels etc.\nA good example of smart agriculture being currently explored by one CSP is how they\ncan improve rice planting with autonomous drones, to optimize seed use, avoid\nplanting during unfavorable weather as well as improve worker efficiency. The drones\nwill be connected to a wireless access network and collect lots of data from sensors\nand sources such as weather reports and then collate all of this data as well as stream\nback live video feeds to the farmers via an app on their smartphone. Machine learning\nand AI will use all of this information to recommend the best time to plant the seeds as\nwell as to pick out the most favorable locations to increase yield and reduce the risk of\ndisease by spotting the disease signs early and recommending immediate actions.\nSolution Architecture powering Autonomous Networks\nTo achieve Autonomous Networks for vertical use cases (as described above),\nmaturity is required across the Resource Loop, Service Loop, Business Loop and User\nLoop.

Autonomous self-service assurance is depicted below as an example of\nusage of Autonomous Networks capabilities, the detailed information can be found at\nTMF catalyst project - Autonomous Networks Hyper Loops and related whitepaper.\nAutonomous Self-Service Assurance\nOne of the key elements of providing seamless autonomous services to farmers is zero\ntrouble service assurance. It’s a leapfrog transformation in the quality of service from\nmanual and reactive troubleshooting to resolve workflows to autonomous\npredictive/preventive self-optimizing and self-healing networks. Autonomous self-\nservice assurance workflow aims at zero impact to services extended to farmers and\noptimizing the total cost of ownership (TCO) for the service provider in managing the\npromise of zero-trouble/zero-impact services.\nThe autonomous workflow depicted below aims at zero-friction services to farmers.\nThe key elements of autonomous service assurance workflow are:\n• Service & Resource usage monitoring (QoS/QoE/SLA)\n• Autonomous Service instance (PM & FM) Analysis\n• Zero-touch service incident reporting and LCM\n• Autonomous Root cause analysis\n• Dynamic Resource Scale In/Out & Optimization\n• Closed-loop remediation with Intent\n• Automated temporary / permanent fix\nAssumption: Service operations layer interacts with resource operations layer based\non Resource Intent which is decomposed from Business & Service Intent.\nFigure 21: Autonomous Service Assurance workflow\n© TM Forum 2023.

China Telecom: Smart Manufacturing – Multi-Cloud and Multi-Base\nAutonomous and Flexible Interconnection\nLarge manufacturers typically own multiple R&D bases, manufacturing campuses, test\nsites and offices. To leverage digital transformation in many areas of the business\nincluding R&D, manufacturing, office buildings and marketing departments,\nmanufacturers require a network to suit the needs of manufacturing, research, quality\ninspection and marketing. Such a network featuring “multi-branch collaboration and\none-point access to multiple clouds” is described in Figure 22.\nFigure 22: Manufacturers’ network needs\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 44 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nTo meet the requirements of manufacturers, China Telecom integrates the cloud\nnetwork and operations system combining with the three-layer AN architecture. This\nallows the company to introduce new technologies and ideas, build the cloud private\nnetwork solution, and implement AN cloud network operations.\nOn one hand, the business and service operations layers deliver cloud network\nmanagement and control capabilities to enterprises. Customized and lightweight\noperations applications and self-service options, such as service self-subscription,\ntraffic control self-adjustment, network self-monitoring and fault self-maintenance are\navailable for enterprise network management personnel. On the other hand, automatic\nand intelligent service orchestration and cloud network resource orchestration and\nscheduling are applied to build service-level slices in private networks for various\nproduction scenarios in the manufacturing industry.\nFor example, dedicated slice and deterministic capability assurance are provided for\nproduction services. IP MANs are used to provide office and outbound services.\nIntelligent slices are used to flexibly plan bandwidth and priorities on demand for\nbroadband scheduling services (such as design solution, video conference and\nfinance). With a complete network topology, the traffic direction and link status on the\nprivate network are monitored in real time.\nAt the resource operations layer, exclusive access devices are deployed in enterprise\ncampuses. These devices are pre-connected to multiple clouds and networks to\nimplement integration-free and one-stop access. Technologies such as slicing, SRv6,\nand in-band detection are introduced, improving the precision and accuracy of\nautomatic network performance detection and the flexibility of intelligent service path\noptimization, and providing differentiated and deterministic SLA assurance for different\napplications.\nFigure 23: Overall architecture of the cloud private network solution\nChina Telecom’s cloud private network solution has been widely applied to thousands\nof large manufacturers, helping them achieve multi-location autonomous\ninterconnection, intelligent traffic control, independent and visualized management\ncontrol, and improved SLAs. The solution deploys private line services into overall\nconnected services, consolidates the capability of one network connection to multiple\nclouds, and provides a better multi-cloud access experience for enterprises. Some of\nthe positive results include:\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 45 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\n• Multi-location autonomous interconnection – shortens the private line\nprovisioning time on both the cloud and network from one to two weeks to a few\nminutes. On-demand and flexible networking is supported, meeting enterprises’\nrequirements for cloud access through any network, one line to multiple clouds,\nand high-quality mutual access between multiple bases.\n• Intelligent traffic control – reduces IT personnel’s workload by 20%.\n• Independent and visualized management control – provisions new connections\nwithin minutes and changes SLA levels such as bandwidth and latency.\n• Improved SLAs – reduces the maximum one-way latency from 15ms to 3ms,\nthe maximum jitter from 60ms to 150ms, and brings down the average packet\nloss rate from 1% to 0.001%, providing high-quality network services for\nenterprises.\n4.1.7. China Unicom: Agile Service Provisioning – Intent-Based Automatic\nProvisioning of Enterprise Private Lines\nLegacy enterprise private line service provisioning was mainly performed manually,\nincluding networking solution design, resource scheduling and resource allocation, and\nthe workflow of service provisioning had breakpoints for automation. When resources\nwere available, the service provisioning still required one week.\nChina Unicom is committed to providing customers with zero-wait and self-provisioning\nagile service experience and proposes an intent-based automatic provisioning solution\nfor private line services. The solution adopts the three-layer architecture of AN and\nuses intention-conversion technology to convert the customers’ business intention into\nthe specific service, sending the request to the orchestration module through the intent\nexecution interface. Figure 24 on the next page shows how autonomous service\nprovisioning works, and an explanation of what happens at each layer follows.\nFigure 24: Autonomous service provisioning\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 46 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nBusiness operation-intent handler – converts a customer’s business intention into a\nservice intention. The handler receives the customer’s intention, determines the\nspecific service through intent matching, and invokes the service through the intent\nexecution interface. Take internet private line provisioning as an example. It is a\nbusiness intention, and through intention matching decides to provision an internet\nprivate line service, such as PON.\nService operation-service orchestration – this refers to the Open Digital Architecture\n(ODA) Product, Service, Resource (PSR) model. The network service is orchestrated\ninto resource- and customer-facing services (RFS and CFS) through a graphical user\ninterface based on the service provisioning action flow. The designed and compiled\nCFS model is deployed to the running state and uses an Open API to provide services.\nFor example, the Internet private line can be orchestrated as PON access CFS, IP\nRAN access CFS, and fiber direct connection CFS.\nResource operation – the provisioning platform is connected to the fixed access\ndomain network management system (NMS), transport domain NMS, line management\nsystem, and public customer system, thus realizing end-to-end automatic provisioning\nof private lines.\nThe intent-based enterprise private line automatic provisioning solution hides the\ncomplexity of the operations and reduces seven manual processes. The provisioning\nduration is shortened from days to minutes. This effectively improves customer\nexperience and improves the autonomous network level from L1+ to L3+ in service\nprovisioning scenarios.\n4.2. Customer Experience and Business Growth\n4.2.1. AIS: Customer Complaint Prevention\nTo improve customer experience (CX), AIS will leverage a new solution called CCP\n(Customer Complaint Prevention), which captures real-time CX data, network events\nand process information based on an AI model to proactively identify poor experiences.\nThen, using resource operations intelligent analysis and a decision engine, AIS can\nidentify customers’ problems and through optimization automation solve them to deliver\na “wow” experience. Figure 25 shows the CCP architecture.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 47 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nFigure 25: shows the CCP architecture\n1. Know customers’ problem before complaints\n• Service impact analysis – AIS captures “site down” events from fault\nmanagement systems and from customers’ probe data to identify customer-\nimpacting events. It integrates the impacted-customers list to an interactive\nvoice response system and through SMS proactively notifies customers,\nintercepting complaints with proactive/ reactive notification.\n• CCP model – using historical complaint data (for example, KPIs, KQIs and\nradio measurement reports) and an AI engine, machines are trained to learn\npoor-experience patterns and output the knowledge to the CCP model. The\nmodel will deploy to real-time environments and based on KPI/ KQI/radio\nevents identify in near real time other customers who have similar problem\npatterns.\na. Self-X capabilities by Intelligent diagnosis\n• Intelligent Diagnosis Engine – once AIS has identified customers with poor\nexperience, the company uses integrated coverage and signaling data, known\nproblem areas, customers’ probe data, network planning data and network fault\nevent data to build an integrated root-cause analysis engine to quickly analyze\nthe root cause of customers’ problems and suggest next best decisions.\n• Network Optimization Engine: around 70% of network complaints are radio\nissues, such as weak coverage, congestion and interference. Once radio issues\nare discovered, the intelligent diagnosis engine can also find problem cells.\nSince radio network optimization involves lots of factors and expert\nexperiences, AIS is trying to build a rules-based engine to consolidate the\noriginal human knowledge base and best practices in order to automatically\nsuggest to next best action to improve network optimization and customer\nexperience.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 48 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nBenefits\nUsing its AN framework, CCP, intelligent diagnosis and a network optimization decision\nengine, AIS can proactively identify customers with poor experience and determine the\nroot cause. Then through the service operations closed loop, the company is able to\nprovide distinctive customer experiences. AIS expects the following results:\n• Reduction of complaints from mobile customers through proactively informing\nthem\n• Increase in first call resolution in the customer care center\n• Reduction of repeated complaints\n• Reduction of average handling time for customers’ complaints.\n4.2.2. HKT：Zero-X Customer Experience on Health Tech Apps (Dr. Go)\nThe Covid-19 pandemic created a market need for remote medical consultation. HKT\n(Hong Kong Telecom) launched a health tech platform called Dr. Go, the objective of\nwhich is to build an intelligent B2B2X platform to link up Health Care partners\n(hospitals, doctors, pharmaceutical companies, etc.) and patient and health products\nconsumers. The Dr. Go apps (see Figure 28) connect patients and doctors through\nhigh-definition video calls. HKT, joining with Huawei technology, deploys the\nautonomous operation concept to enable Zero-X experience.\nFigure 26: Dr. Go apps functions\nDr. Go apps eliminate human support in booking appointments with doctors, to achieve\nzero-touch. The appointment bookings are made through self-selection, and calls to\ntalk to doctors are also established within seconds, achieving zero-wait. To achieve\nzero- trouble, an Autonomous Operation approach focuses on the service closed loop\nand the resource closed loop.\nTo ensure quality video calls, Autonomous Operation with AI modelling and Customer\nExperience Index+ (CEI+) digital metrics are being used for service guarantee of all\nvideo calls. Figure 27 shows the autonomous framework concept used in the use case.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

When the CEI is low, the Intelligent Engine will look at the quality of\nexperience (QoE) and the KPI/KQI responsible for changing VMOS (Video Mean\nOpinion Score) figures. Identifying the problem set of figures, the Intelligent Engine will\ncommand the relevant resources cluster to provide additional resources to improve the\nVMOS figures.\nFigure 28: Intelligent Engine to support Zero-X\nBusiness benefits and outcomes\nWith the advance in Autonomous Operation, HKT is able to provide zero-trouble\nconnections to Dr. Go apps. Patient and Doctor are able to experience high-quality\nvideo connections during medical consultation. With good experience and word of\nmouth, the customer base increased by 214% year over year. Dr. Go also won “Asia\nSmart Apps Award 2021 – Public Sector and Social Innovation” and “The Global\nEconomics Award 2022 – Technology: Best Telemedicine Mobile Apps”.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Telkomsel Indonesia: AI for Crowdsourced User Experience\nUser experience is replacing network performance as a main criteria for assessing\nCSPs’ network operation and maintenance. As a core strategy of Telkomsel, its AN\nefforts are focusing on user centricity. Traditional service experience optimization\nmethods rely on engaging significant manpower in test-driving and analysis, but while\nthese costly activities consume lot of time, the impact to overall users’ experience\nremains uncertain.\nTo overcome this challenge, Telkomsel has worked with ZTE and other partners to\ndevelop a solution that uses crowdsourced data as additional user experience\nassessment criteria and enables a network optimization closed-loop automation for\nimproving application-level experience. With this solution, the service layer manages\nexperience-to-network mapping, network assessment and proactive assurance.

China Mobile：Intelligent Diagnosis of Network Quality for Home\nBroadband Services\nAfter the epidemic in 2020, rigid demands for home offices and online education have\nbeen activated. The rapid popularity of new applications such as video live broadcast,\nXR games, and smart home has further promoted the development and popularization\nof home broadband services, especially gigabit broadband. The diversity of\nrequirements and services raises higher requirements on broadband rates, latency,\navailability, and fault rectification. Therefore, how to comprehensively and accurately\nperceive the service experience of each home broadband user, provide certain service\nassurance, and obtain greater business value through precision marketing of value-\nadded services are the key issues that CSPs need to address in the operation of home\nbroadband services.\n• Experience assurance: Existing problems such as insensitive perception,\ninaccurate positioning and untimely processing could greatly affect the user\nexperience of home broadband services.\n• Value improvement: Users' requirements for value improvement services such\nas quality improvement (different SLA assurance), home networking, and smart\nhome cannot be accurately identified.\nChina Mobile fully absorbs the concept of \"single-domain autonomy and cross-domain\ncollaboration\" of autonomous networks and introduces technologies such\nas Xgboost algorithm, edge computing, telemetry second-level collection, big data\nanalysis, and network topology restoration. Focus on improving Self-X capabilities,\nsuch as self-marketing for target customers, self-monitoring/reporting of service quality,\nself-orchestration of network resources, self-healing of faults, and self-optimization of\nperformance, to achieve precise value improvement and proactive service experience\nassurance.\n• Self-guaranteed service experience, self-healing and self-\noptimization: The service operation layer monitors and reports user\nexperience in real time, proactively identifies users with a poor experience,\npredicts complaints and prevents mass faults, drives user marketing or\nretention, and improves service and network quality. The service operation\nlayer automatically analyzes the various code streams of video and games\ntraffic in real time, finely identifies traffic types, and perceives the quality\nproblem of different traffic according to the preset differential threshold. It\norchestrates and schedules resources in real time to ensure service quality. It\nalso drives the expansion or optimization of associated networks such as\ntransmission and content distribution and drives content introduction. Based on\ndistributed OLT edge computing and cloud platform AI, the resource operation\nlayer automatically identifies the top 50+ applications with poor quality and\nreports service or network faults. For the link diagnosed with poor quality, the\nspectral clustering algorithm is used to analyze the performance index such as\noptical current, power, bit error rate, quickly locating the end-to-end network\nproblems.\n• Self-marketing for target customers and precise value improvement: The\nservice operation layer automatically recommends marketing based on user\npreferences and tariffs and provides self-subscription services. Customers can\nsubscribe to services on demand and flexibly combine services. The service\noperation layer comprehensively analyzes user services, tariffs, experience,\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 53 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nand network information to identify value-added service target customers. The\nresource operation layer provides the network and resource information of\nsubscribers' locations and provides customer service preference and service\nexperience perception.\nAfter the solution being applied in China Mobile Henan’s existing network, 450,000\ncases of poor-quality problems, 8,000 poor quality lines and 150 poor quality content\nsources were actively identified. The diagnostic rate reached 90%. The network\nproblems were dealt with ahead of customer complaints, which effectively improved the\nsatisfaction with home broadband services. The ANL is increased from L2 to L3.\n• Zero interruption and proactive experience assurance: The accuracy of\nproactive identification of poor-quality home broadband services is 95%, the\nuser experience is significantly improved by 83%, and the average fault locating\nduration is reduced from 2.1 hours to 10 minutes. The system accurately\nidentifies network bottlenecks and drives capacity expansion planning,\nimproving the average user rate by 45%.\n• Self-marketing improves quality and revenue: The target customer\nidentification rate of value-added services reaches 95%. The success rate of\nsmart home networking packages increases by 30%.\n4.2.5. MTN：Build a Mobile Bearer Network with The Best Experience,\nEnabling Self-Optimization and Self-Closed-Loop Management\nMTN has 19 mobile transport networks that are mainly operated in the African\ncontinent. Most of the subnets face insufficient transport resources and uneven traffic,\nresulting in traffic suppression on the mobile network. However, due to the lack of\neffective analysis tools, precise investment cannot be implemented to maximize value.\nTraffic distribution changes caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and site visit difficulties\nexacerbate this situation.\nSolution\nTo give full play to network values and ensure user experience, MTN adapted the A-A-\nD-E (Awareness-Analysis-Decision-Execution) cognitive closed-loop into the transport\nnetwork as “awareness- demarcation-locating, relief-recovery” to build a self-\noptimization and self-healing, congestion-free mobile transport network.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 54 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nFigure 30: IP Autonomous Network with congestion-free mobile transport\nWith the implementation of the congestion-free solution, IP Autonomous Network is\nachieved through:\nResource closed loop\nAwareness\n• Microwave and congested link identification – end-to-end two-way active\nmeasurement protocol (TWAMP) detection is used to identify poor-QoE\nmicrowave segments and bearer network congestion points.\n• Online wireless traffic suppression detection – visualized wireless traffic\nsuppression on the entire network, such as ranking of suppressed areas by\nproportion and digitalization of suppressed traffic, guides customers to invest in\nnetwork optimization and helps verify the investment effect.\nAnalysis (demarcation and locating)\n• Transport network congestion analysis – if wireless traffic is suppressed due\nto insufficient bandwidth on the transport network, Network Cloud Engine (NCE)\nuses quality measurement solutions for service flows and network paths, such\nas TWAMP, to restore the forwarding paths of wireless service traffic on the\ntransport network, identify congestion bottlenecks on the transport network and\nprovide guidance for capacity expansion planning. If the wireless traffic is\nsuppressed due to instantaneous traffic surge, NCE automatically starts the\nreal-time, high-precision, hop-by-hop measurement solution to identify poor-\nQoS services and restore the end-to-end service topology. Service SLA\ndeterioration can be clearly identified and located within three minutes.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 55 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nDecision and Execution (relief and recovery)\n• Intelligent path optimization – combined with the SRv6 intelligent path\noptimization capability, NCE supports intelligent path computation with 15+\nfactors and minute-level traffic scheduling, accurately adjusts network paths,\nbalances network traffic distribution, and implements minute-level self-\noptimization for congestion problems.\nIntent Report\n• Intelligent incident management – in the next phase, for unexpected\ncongestion caused by network faults such as device forwarding, link, and\ninterface capability failure, downgrade, and path failure, NCE uses AI-based\nintelligent incident management to automatically correlate root-cause faults and\nservices. Faults can be quickly rectified based on the fault troubleshooting plan,\nand congestion problems caused by faults can be automatically rectified.\nService closed loop\nWith the congestion-free solution, SLAs of mobile bearer services are visible,\nmanageable and committed, providing users with deterministic service experience.\nBusiness closed loop\nBased on continuous traffic suppression analysis and high-value area analysis,\noperator can quickly identify investment priorities and make precise investments based\non capacity expansion and rectification suggestions, to continuously improve service\nexperience on the bearer network.\nBenefits\nMTN South Africa continues to use the traffic suppression model to analyze congestion\non the live network and provide guidance for precise capacity expansion.\nThe average daily traffic suppression data decreases by 28%. MTN Nigeria uses\nintelligent optimization to reduce the average recovery time of fiber cuts from three\nhours to minutes, improving bandwidth utilization by 30% on average, and ensuring\nuser experience.\n4.2.6. MTN：NFVO Enable Network Auto-deployment, Auto-adaptation and\nIntelligent Anomalies Awareness\nRecently, MTN has been accelerating its telecom cloud strategy: MUNIC. In particular,\nautomation is the key component of the MUNIC 2.0 strategy and is under planning and\ndeployment. With the application of cloud-native architecture and the introduction of\nslicing and MEC scenarios, the cloud-based core network has been becoming\nincreasingly complex. There are one hundred times more maintenance objects and the\nchange operations occur more frequently. In such complex O&M scenarios, traditional\nmethods are no longer fit for purpose.\nNFVO functions as an orchestration system providing network function virtualization\nservices. It is used to orchestrate and schedule NFV network services and resources,\nimplement automatic network deployment and unified O&M, and accelerate the\nautomatic transformation based on MTN's MUNIC 2.0 strategy. In addition, NFVO is\nalso an indispensable component facilitating the evolution from level 3 and level 4 of\nthe ADN. By managing, controlling, and analyzing network resources, NFVO can\ncomplete closed-loop handling of resources and achieve the vision of \"self-\nconfiguration\".\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 56 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nFigure 31: Autonomous Core Network Architecture\nSolution Introduction:\nAutomatic network deployment. The architecture of the core network is rather\ncomplex. As a result, traditional methods of network configuration can be seriously\ninefficient. Configuration scripts are sent to switches or routers manually, taking more\nthan two weeks to compile the network configuration and more than one week to\nconfigure the network. This has severe impacts on delivery efficiency.\nNFVO provides the automatic DCN configuration capabilities and automatically\ngenerates NSD and VNFD files. Afterwards, NFVO delivers commands to complete\nnetwork configuration and VNF deployment. By automating the previously manual\noperations, the network generation time is shortened from several weeks to a couple of\ndays, significantly improving network configuration and deployment efficiency.\nNetwork automatic adaptation. Traditionally, the capacity expansion of VNFs is\nmanually performed. Moreover, there is little collaboration between manual network\nconfiguration and VNF capacity expansion. As a result, VM networks are disconnected\nafter the capacity expansion. In migration scenarios, related network configurations\nand security policies cannot be migrated at the same time as VMs. NFVO supports\nautomatic network adjustment, online visualized network editing, and real-time\ndetection of NE changes. During capacity expansion and service migration, network\nconfigurations can be automatically streamlined, and security and QoS policies can be\nmigrated.\nNetwork anomalies awareness. Thousands of counters exist in the core network. As\nsuch, distinguishing the key counters from others is a daunting task. With NFVO, the\nnetwork performance can be monitored, and the correlated counters and counter\nreports can be customized so that any issues regarding these counters can be\nanalyzed, regardless of their types. In order to facilitate performance analysis, the KPI\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 57 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\ninsight feature of NFVO has two major functions: network quality monitoring and root\ncause analysis expert. KPI insight monitors the counters by classifying them into six\ncategories: accessibility, retainability, mobility, capacity, coverage, and service quality.\nCounter exceptions can be detected within 5 minutes. Additionally, KPI insight provides\nflexible drilling and correlation functions to locate the root cause of issues related to the\naforementioned counters and enables users to customize counter thresholds when the\nfunctions are being used. KPI insight is a fast, precise, and powerful feature.\nFuture Outlook\nIn the future, we will continue our efforts in the field of NFVO to build network\nmanagement, control, and analysis capabilities, raise the automation and intelligence\nlevels of E2E management throughout the core-network life cycle, and keep improving\nnetwork deployment and O&M efficiency in multiple scenarios, such as the centralized\ncloud and MEC.\n4.2.7. MTN：Business Intent Close Loop\nLike all global CSPs MTN needs to address a number of key challenges including\nmanaging the huge traffic growth driven by OTT and video streaming, increase ARPU\nand shutdown legacy networks such as 3G to re-farm the frequencies to deliver\nCAPEX and OPEX efficiencies.\nTo increase data usage, MTN launched a Double Data initiative and promoting and\nmigrating users from existing 2G and 3G networks to 4G was a key priority. To ensure\nsuccess, MTN developed a framework that supports automation in most aspects of this\ninitiative to address the following challenges:\n• Difficulty in identifying potential 4G users – dynamic profiling of subscribers that\nhave the highest propensity to accept migration proposals e.g., a user\ngenerating more than 30MB using a 2G device\n• Low migration efficiency and low marketing success rate – additional metrics to\nsupport campaign initiatives such as recent user behavior on the network and\noffer acceptance rate\n• High fallback of 4G users due to poor 4G network quality\nTo overcome these challenges an end-to-end cross-functional 2/3G to 4G User\nMigration use-case was implemented. At the technology layer and to automate\nidentification of potential users, an advanced analytical capability was implemented\npowered by Huawei’s SmartCare solution in some of the MTN operating markets.\nA joint operation team with MTN was put in place to accelerate the development of the\n4G users. It utilized the MAN (Market, Area, Network) model to maximize the value of\nthe user migration lifecycle based on the 4G user journey. MAN provided a 360\ndegrees holistic view through AI based modeling by leveraging on data from OSS, BSS\nand social media. The model provides insights such as subscriber location distribution\nwith key behaviors, network readiness index distribution, marketing readiness index\ndistribution and target area/city.\nIntent Driven Interactions\nFor this particular use case the business intent is to migrate 2G and 3G users to 4G.\nIntent is one of the key components that make up the TM Forum Autonomous Network\nframework. The role of intent in autonomous network is to clearly communicate\nrequirements and goals.\nFor this use case data is collected from various sources such as OSS and BSS to\nidentify the potential 4G users. An intent report is produced to show the marketing\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 58 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nsuccess of the campaign. The intent report will show the status and success of the\nintent handling.\nArchitecture and Solution\nFigure 32: Architecture and Solution\nThe diagram above shows the 4 steps of the user migration solution which are\ndescribed below:\n• Step 1- Accurate Identification of Potential 4G Users: AI/ML model is used\nto develop smart insights. Algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and\nGDBT (Gradient Boosting Decision Tree) are used for 4G user identification by\nleveraging on OSS, BSS, service and user segment analysis data. It analyzes\nusers who do terminal switch, SIM card replacement and 4G terminal\nreplacement and will output user value, service behavior, geographical location\nand user group classification.\n• Step 2- Package Tariff Design and Promotion Scheme: Data from the\nprevious analysis is used to ensure precise marketing by designing subscriber\npackage tariffs based on subscriber ARPU and migration bonus.\n• Step 3- Marketing Campaign Execution: The lists of potential users are\nprovided to the MTN marketing system from SmartCare and the campaign is\nexecuted. To maximize success, we have clear campaign rules, methodology\nfor scheduling and prioritization of subscribers, tailored rewards and SMS\nexecution.\n• Step 4- Post-migration Evaluation: We monitor the migrated users looking at\nthe trend and traffic and service behavior. A weekly report is produced to show\nthe marketing campaign success and the effect of the reward scheme.\nImpact of 2/3G to 4G User Migration Use Case\nTypical improvements we have seen includes: Support Double Data initiative through\nincreased DOU，User migration efficiency improves by 80%，4G user retention rate\nincreases from 79% to 92%.\n4.2.8. XL Axiata: Market Expansion Through Outcome-Based Decision,\nIntent-Driven System\nXL Axiata is focusing on creating customer segments to ensure availability and\naffordability of its products and realize the marketing strategy called “right product, right\nsegment”. The idea is to improve customer lifetime value (CLV) and deliver sustainable\nbusiness value.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 59 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nThe traditional siloed and disjointed analysis and decision-making processes with rules\nrelying on human experiences usually lead to low efficiency and inaccuracy. Powered\nby an outcome-based decision intent-driven system under the autonomous framework,\nthe customized marketing recommendation can be generated automatically, which\nimproves efficiency and accuracy and finally increases revenue.\nFigure 33: Outcome-based decision, intent-driven system\nFigure 33 on the previous page shows that self-marketing is achieved through\nbusiness closed loop with the introduction of the autonomous outcome-based decision\nintent-driven system:\n• Business growth objective – provide customized products to meet the\ndemand of the market and to increase market share. It is achieved through data\nanalytics to understand the needs of the customers and develop a business\nclosed loop linking up the market business operation and service operation in\nthe sales offering.\n• Operations efficiencies objective – improve the efficiency of analysis about\nuser segments and accuracy of customized marketing. With the business\nclosed loop, the service operation is able to change faster and map according\nto the package that the system thinks the customers require. Service offering\ncan be implemented through autonomous operation and does not require\nhuman intervention. The results will be feedback to the intent-driven system,\nand continuous improvement is achieved through AI modelling over data\nanalytics.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

The autonomous system developed a\nspecial digital twin for decision intelligence, which includes a detailed description of the\nobjects and their relationship in the telecom marketing scenario. After the execution of\na decision generated by the system, business outcomes verification as well as the\ncontinuous improvement is done after the market feedback data is integrated into the\ndigital twin.\nBusiness impacts\nBased on current co-innovation, efficiency of marketing analysis and decision-making\nis significantly improved, and the direct revenue of the target value region is expected\nto increase over the next year. In addition, XL Axiata is planning to explore more\nbusiness opportunities in the fixed-mobile convergence (FMC) market during the next\nyear.\n4.2.9. Cloud-Network Low-Latency AN Solution\nCloud access has become a primary need in the course of enterprises' digital\ntransformation. However, carriers face the following problems in providing services:\n• Traditional networks provide non-differentiated connection services, which\ncannot guarantee the experience of services that have special requirements on\nlatency, such as videos and games.\n• Dozens of links are deployed between backbone nodes on an IP network. Due\nto limited resources, traffic is forwarded in load balancing mode, causing\nunstable latency for high-value services. To ensure a low latency, the traffic\nprocessing mode needs to be manually adjusted, which takes a long time and\ninvolves complicated error-prone configurations.\nTo improve the poor tenant experience due to a long latency on cloud private lines, a\nlong service optimization period, and other issues, carrier A and Huawei jointly\ndeployed the first commercial E2E cloud-network low-latency plane for Internet\nservices. The SDN+SRv6 policy-based IP AN solution and digital and service-oriented\ncapabilities on the network resource layer are used to enable service and business\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 61 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\noperations and achieve three-layer collaborative closed-loop management,\nimplementing a highly autonomous network with ultra-low latency.\nFigure 35: Cloud-Network Low-Latency AN Solution architecture\n• Business operations: Flexible service self-orchestration enables tenant\nself-service. A real-time digital network map is developed to display the latency\nof the entire network and form a service-oriented latency circle. Service\nsubscription pre-evaluation is supported to ensure that the latency meets\nservice requirements. Tenants can subscribe to service SLA changes. Network\ncapabilities are provided as a series of e-commerce products for tenants.\n• Service operations: Service self-healing enables deterministic network\nservices. The digital network map features more than 15 built-in path\ncomputation factors, which can be used to automatically plan network paths\nthat meet service SLA requirements, providing a low latency and real-time\nmonitoring assurance for VIP services. Faults can be located within just a few\nminutes, and poor-QoE services can be automatically optimized, delivering a\nlow-latency for VIP users.\n• Resource operations: Network autonomy, intelligent scheduling of\nnetwork-wide tunnels, and automatic optimization upon congestion. The\nSRv6 tunnel optimization solution uses technologies such as TWAMP and\ntelemetry to detect the service SLA status in real time. If the latency increases,\nintelligent tunnel optimization is triggered to optimize network traffic distribution\nand ensure that the SLA is met for VIP services, improving O&M efficiency by\nmore than 30% when compared with the traditional adjustment method.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 62 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nTraffic has been optimized for approximately 100 links between more than 20 core\nrouters in Fujian province. The service latency from Ningde to Quanzhou is reduced by\n53.4%, and that from Ningde to Xiamen is reduced by 44.7%, significantly improving\ntenant service experience and accelerating the evolution towards AN. Huawei will\ncontinue to work with carriers to further explore innovative network autonomy solutions\nto tackle major concerns about cloud-network services, in order to provide on-demand\nintelligent scheduling of computing power and networks, lower the O&M cost, and\nconserve energy.\n4.2.10. Intent-Driven AN (IDAN) Use Cases\nBusiness, service and network operations are becoming increasingly complex as they\nencompass multiple domains using multiple partners’ solutions. This means that\nmanual and static processes must give way to model- and knowledge-driven\napproaches that are based on business intent. By adopting a knowledge-centric\napproach, services can adapt and evolve autonomously as network conditions,\nbusiness goals and customers’ requirements shift over time.\nCustomers can have a better experience if their needs are captured and translated into\nintent without revealing any implementation details. Autonomous systems are\ngoverned according to intents, which are standardized by using an open interface. The\nmulti-phased Intent-driven Autonomous Networks for Smart Mobility Catalyst\ndeveloped an initial intent interface and model that works at all three operational layers\n– intents at the business layer, which will “cascade” (not decompose!) down to the\nservice and resource layers.\nUse case 1: Intent-driven Autonomous Networks for smart mobility\nThis use case is a cellular vehicle-to-everything (C-V2X) scenario that demonstrates\nhow true intent implementations decouple layers and allow for better optimization of\nservices and resources based on the business objectives defined by the CSP. CSPs\nwant to apply autonomous network technologies and principles to the problem space of\ntoll road operations/transportation.\nFigure 36: illustrates IDAN phase I\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 63 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nIn this case, the autonomous network uses Intent APIs to automatically convert user\nrequirements at the application layer into network languages, implementing agile\nservice provisioning and simplified operation. At the same time, networks are\nautomatically optimized based on user requirements and network status to implement\nintelligent O&M.\nRoad users communicate their requirements at the application layer.\nThe autonomous network automatically divides user requirements layer by layer (Intent\nAPI at business layer -> service layer -> resource layer), translates requirements into\nsystem instructions and executes them.\nThe AN feedback the instruction execution result to the user or upper-layer system\nlayer by layer.\nEach autonomous layer of the overall system architecture leverages an intent\napproach and this, in turn, changes the focus to each system to be more self-\ncontained, autonomous systems that focus on their respective closed loops.\nUse case 2: Intent-driven Autonomous Networks for dynamic pricing\nconnectivity service\nThis use case demonstrates a dynamic pricing scenario that provides zero-touch\ncustomer experience, self-healing and self-optimization capabilities leveraging intent.\nThe scenario applies to customers needing non-real-time connectivity, such as large\nresearch institutions or hospitals, which need to periodically synchronize a large\namount of data with a data center or cloud. In this mode, customers can obtain higher-\nexperience services with lower tariffs, and carriers can better utilize idle bandwidth\nresources to obtain more value without disrupting existing business. Figure 37 on the\nnext page illustrates IDAN phase II.\nFigure 37: IDAN-Phase 2 – TMF921 Intent “red lollipop” for AN\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 64 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\n• Business layer – refers to the “spot pricing” business model to enable users to\nobtain services with a higher user experience at lower tariffs.\n• Service layer – translates the service intent through the Intent Management\nFunction (IMF), creates the service order for cross-domain and cross-vendor\nservice orchestration and works with service-based assurance to close the\nassurance loop.\n• Resource layer – uses intent-based interfaces to drive fast service provisioning\nand network slicing at the network layer, and triggers agile and intelligent fault\ndiagnosis and rectification based on alarms.\nThe Catalyst developed a complete intent interface (from swagger to user guide to fully\nworking reference implementation) as a formal contribution to TMF921 Intent\nmanagement API and the associated intent ontology (Turtle) to make the intent\napproach more concrete and real. Figure 38 shows how the Catalyst uses multiple\ninnovations to create a uniform yet flexible interface that allows the intent-driven\napproach to be applied to not only dynamic pricing but to any use case of scale across\nAN.\nFigure 38: Intent can be applied to any AN use case\n4.2.11. Intent-driven Service Grading Experience Assurance\nAs is known to all, the communications industry, as the basic industry of national\neconomy and people's livelihood, shoulders the mission of ensuring national\nconstruction and the normal operation of various industries, and is the cornerstone of\nsocial development. In daily life, communication assurance is the most common\nscenario, ranging from important meetings, earthquake relief, entertainment, and\nsporting games. CSPs often need to guarantee the proper implementation of\ncommunication activities and avoid communication faults caused by unexpected\nproblems, which has a great negative impact on the entire major event.\nTraditional service assurance has the following disadvantages:\n• High technical requirements and high requirements for guaranty personnel.\n• It is difficult to respond to service changes and emergencies in a timely manner.\n• The guaranteed effect is not obvious, and user experience cannot be\nguaranteed.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 65 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\n• It is difficult to support continuous assurance, and the assurance strategy\ncannot be flexibly adjusted with the changes of network conditions.\nWith the wide introduction and application of intelligent technologies in the 5G era, the\nrequirements for intelligent, simple, and de-risky communication assurance are\nincreasingly urgent. In this context, the time has come to integrate Intent Network into\nthe mainstream business scenarios in the communications field.\nFunctions\nThe Intent-Driven Service Grading Experience Guarantee Project changes the O&M\nmode from \"How to do\" to \"What to do\" for the first time in the industry to guarantee the\ntop-speed service experience guarantee driven by natural language and zero-process\nintervention.\n• The network intelligently translates the intent entered by a user with a natural\nlanguage.\n• The network provides self-adaptive assurance for a type of specific services\nbased on translation, and the assurance is divided into multiple levels as\nrequired.\n• The network automatically perceives the scenario of service assurance, and\ndynamically adjusts the assurance policy to ensure that the effect continuously\nmeets the standard.\nThese functions ensure that the user experience of services in specific scenarios\nreaches the desired level, and thus provide real network assurance with good\nunderstanding.\nBenefits\nThis case verified the commercial use of Tencent video playing, live streaming,\nMinzhengtong QR scanning and WeChat video conferencing services. In the actual\nverification, each guaranteed level of different applications has been verified many\ntimes. The highest throughput can be increased by 760.55%, and the lowest delay can\nbe reduced by 88.70%. Compared with the traditional assurance mode, the assurance\nefficiency is increased by five times. The economic benefits of this case are mainly to\nsave and assurance human and material costs, and to assure the benefits of new\ntraffic on sites.\nFigure 39: Architecture of Intent-driven service grading experience assurance solution\n© TM Forum 2023.

China Mobile: New Radio (NR) Network Coverage Optimization\nMassive MIMO is an evolved form of multiple-antenna technology, which is widely\nregarded as a key 5G network technology. This technology integrates more radio\nfrequency (RF) channels and antennas to implement three-dimensional precise beam\nforming and multi-stream multi-user multiplexing. Massive MIMO achieves better\ncoverage and larger capacity than traditional technologies. In contrast with 4G massive\nMIMO that supports more than 200 broadcast beam combinations, 5G massive MIMO\nsupports thousands of broadcast beam combinations. The pattern adjustment scope\nvaries according to AAU types. Pure manual configuration and adjustment of broadcast\nbeam combinations cannot achieve the optimal performance of massive MIMO due to\nits complexity. When massive MIMO modules are deployed on a large scale, the\nadjustment workload is heavy, and it is challenging to complete the adjustment\nmanually.\nAccording to the test results of multiple CSPs on the live network, massive MIMO\nintelligent optimization can improve the reference signal received power (RSRP) and\nuser equipment (UE) throughput while maximizing CSPs' ROI.\nTo meet the challenges brought by large-scale commercial rollout of 5G networks, the\nonline massive MIMO intelligent optimization solution can automatically collect basic\nnetwork data, automatically analyze and generate optimization solutions based on\ndrive tests data, and directly evaluate online KPIs in real time. This solution effectively\nresolves weak coverage, interference, and co- coverage problems, improves coverage\ngains, and ensures user throughput.\n• Optimization Intent Delivery: Obtains coverage optimization areas and\nobjectives, such as the proportion of weak coverage areas from the service\nmanagement layer.\n• Data Self-awareness: Through the scenario-oriented API obtains drive test\ndata, performance counters, traffic statistics, engineering parameters,\nconfiguration parameters and other basic information including electronic maps,\nantenna patterns, frequency bands, and AAU types.\n• Policy Self-generation and Self-execution: Performs iterative reinforcement\nAI learning based on the preset optimization objectives to obtain the optimal\noptimization advice. It automatically delivers the massive MIMO pattern\nparameter combination, down tilt, and azimuth parameters of problematic cells\nand their neighboring cells based on the Massive MIMO pattern common AI\nmodel.\n• Data Self-analysis: Creates grids for DT/MR data, identifies problematic grids,\nand merges them into problematic areas. The RAN Manager selects the best\nscenario-based beam, azimuth, and down tilt configurations for problematic\ncells. In this step, antenna hardware must meet the corresponding configuration\nrequirements.\nIn a typical operator application scenario, the RAN Manager (wireless resource\nmanagement layer) interconnects with the network management system (NMS)\n(service management layer) through an open API. The NMS delivers the network\ncoverage optimization objectives and areas to be optimized to the RAN Manager. The\nRAN manager sends the final optimization result and optimization advice of each round\nto the NMS of the operator.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

China Mobile: “Zero-touch” Reliability guarantee of 5G network\n(automated faults handling)\nWith the rapid growth of 5G networks the average daily network alarms from provincial\nsubsidiaries exceed 10 million, involving multiple network domains, long collaborative\nchain and complex dependency relationships. With the development of 5G to B\nservices, enterprise customers have higher requirements for network fault detection\nand processing efficiency. They therefore urgently need to transform to the predictive\nand preventive maintenance mode that integrates human-machine and data-driven\nservices to improve fault self-guaranteed and self-healing capabilities.\nThe Zero-touch Reliability guarantee of 5G network business solution uses single-\ndomain autonomy and cross-domain collaboration as the core principle to build a fault\nmanagement framework with comprehensive real-time sensing, automatic anomaly\ndiagnosis, and intelligent decision-making.\n• Single-domain autonomy: The resource operation layer improves the self-\nguaranteed capabilities of wireless, transmission, and core network domains,\nincluding the large-capacity alarm processing capability of 2000 alarms per\nsecond, the 1000:1 alarm compression capability, and the network\nconfiguration capability of 800 atomic networks for the service operation layer to\nsupport fault self-healing.\n© TM Forum 2023.

After applying in the network, main faults such as batch base station out of\nservice can be cleared within 30 minutes, with average processing efficiency increased\nby 40%. The number of invalid work orders is reduced by more than 20%. The fault\nhandling efficiency of frontline maintenance personnel is improved by 80%, and that of\nsecond-line maintenance personnel is improved by 25%. The autonomous network\nlevel has increased from L2 to L3.\n4.3.3. China Telecom: Agile Provisioning of 5G Customized Network\nAs a key cloud-network convergence product, China Telecom’s 5G customized\nnetwork is a comprehensive solution featuring “network customization, edge\nintelligence, cloud collaboration, and X on-demand”. The company aims to build\nintegrated, customized and converged services for customers and implement “cloud-\nnetwork convergence and on-demand customization”.\nHowever, the 5G customized network solution involves many professional networks,\nsystems and service industries. In addition, due to the short commercial use time,\nobstacles such as too many handling steps, difficult requirement translation, slow\nresource survey, and high proportion of manual orchestration and configuration still\nexist during service provisioning. It will take a long time to realize ultra-premium\nservices.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

Combined with the three-layer architecture of ANs, this solution focuses on\nthe autonomous capability of cloud network operations.\nThe resource operations layer aims to achieve single-domain autonomy and enables\nupper-layer applications, improving network situation self-awareness and facilitating\nnetwork self-configuration. On the business and service operations layers, China\nTelecom first aims to improve customer experience and build capabilities such as e-\ncommerce service and intent-based requirement translation. To improve resource\nutilization and ensure service quality, China Telecom is attempting is to generate end-\nto-end autonomous capabilities, including online resource survey, automatic\norchestration and scheduling, and automatic generation of a configuration solution.\nFigure 42 depicts the solution architecture, and a more detailed description follows.\nFigure 42: Agile provisioning of 5G customized network solution\nEquipped with the intelligent functions of China Telecom’s next-generation cloud\nnetwork operation service system, the solution integrates autonomous capabilities of\nthe cloud network operations and implements the following, greatly shortening the\nservice provisioning time and improving user experience.\n• Template-based product design – the cloud network service design center\nbuilds the product template product structure tree (PST) to implement one-point\nproduct design and network-wide loading.\n• Intent-based requirement translation and end-to-end collaborative orchestration\n– the service orchestration center translates customer intents into SLA\nparameters, implementing orchestration of various types of configurations such\nas end-to-end slice/ sub-slice, multi-domain collaborative private line, and\nnumber subscription configuration.\n• Integrated solution design – the resource and data sharing platform realizes the\nunified allocation and management of line resources and slice resources.\n• Automatic configuration and provisioning – the collection and control platform\nimplements slice management configuration and end-to-end cloud network\nconfiguration.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Most of China Telecom’s provincial\nsubsidiaries have launched function modules including automatic provisioning,\nautomatic change, automatic un-subscription, and troubleshooting in their production\nsystems. These modules support agile service provisioning, including 5G slice private\nlines and super number cards, shortening the provisioning time from two to four weeks\nto instant availability and greatly improving customer experience. By the end of 2021,\nChina Telecom had provisioned nearly 500 5G slice private lines, generating total\nrevenue of 270 million Yuan ($39.6 million).\n4.3.4. China Unicom：Smart Operation of 5G Bearer Network- Zero Waiting\nProvisioning and Confirmatory SLA Guarantee\nWith the rapid deployment of 5G networks, the provisioning efficiency and SLA\nassurance capability of 5G bearer networks are one of the key areas of concern for\nCSPs.

MTN：Building an All-Optical Automated Network to Enable Agile\nBusiness and Intelligent O&M\nThe digital economy and digital transformation of industries pose new requirements for\nCSPs’ network capabilities and operations. An intelligent, native, efficient and reliable\nnetwork with deterministic experience is now the development direction for future\nnetworks. MTN is actively carrying out network digital transformation in line with its\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 72 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nAmbition 2025 strategy, MTN promotes the exploration, practice and application\ninnovation of autonomous networks based on optical network automation scenarios.\nChallenges\nWith the deployment of optical infrastructure networks and the rapid development of\noptical services, MTN is facing challenges in terms of time to market (TTM) and O&M\nefficiency. Table 9 describes the challenges.\nChallenge Root Cause Description\nLong TTM for The offline route design and service provisioning need to be\nservices manually performed, which is time- and effort-consuming and\nleads to low efficiency.\nThe offline system resource check is time- and effort-consuming,\nand the data is inaccurate.\nInefficient O&M Fiber and OCh faults frequently occur, and most of them are slow-\nchange faults, which are difficult to detect in advance.\nFiber cuts have a great impact on services, but there is no reliable\nO&M method available to reduce the impact and prevent future\nfiber cuts.\nTable 9: Optical network challenges\nSolutions and benefits\nWith the intelligent management and control system as the core, the all-optical AN\nsolution introduces AI to the NE, network and service layers to implement efficient\nO&M of all-optical networks and provide industry customers with zero-touch, zero-wait\nand zero-fault premium private line service experience. Figure 44 shows the approach,\nand a more detailed explanation follows.\nFigure 44: All-optical AN with intelligent management and control system\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 73 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nResource closed loop\n• Agile service provisioning – to shorten the service TTM, improve the service\ngo-to-market pace and accelerate business monetization, automatic service\nprovisioning is provided for MTN in South Africa. The simplified model of\nautomatic service provisioning and multi-factor route calculation policies (the\nmost comprehensive routing policies in the industry, meeting differentiated\nmarket requirements) greatly improve the one-time service provisioning\nsuccess rate, shortening the TTM from weeks to minutes and providing the\nultimate service experience with zero-wait time.\n• Optical network resource assurance – in the resource check phase before\nservice provisioning, the resource visualization function of the optical network\nresource assurance solution is utilized to implement minutes-level resource\ncheck, improving service provisioning efficiency. Additionally, based on\nhistorical data, AI algorithms can be used to predict resource requirements in\nthe next 12 months, facilitating capacity expansion in advance and eliminating\nthe need for frequent emergency capacity expansion.\n• Optical network health assurance – in terms of O&M efficiency improvement,\nthe focus is on tackling frequent fiber and OCH deterioration faults that cannot\nbe detected in advance. For this purpose, the optical network health assurance\nsolution has been introduced in the MTN project in South Africa. Based on rich\noptical sensors, big data collection and analysis, and AI algorithm-based\nprediction capabilities, this solution helps analyze the health status of each fiber\nand OCH on the entire network in real time, predicts fiber fault risks and fault\nlocations in advance, and provides handling suggestions, realizing proactive\nO&M. The solution helps MTN identify more than 95% of fiber and OCH\ndeterioration faults in advance, reducing the fault-locating duration by 83% and\nreducing fiber cuts by 30%.\n• Optical Availability Assurance – high availability is the lifeline of networks\nand services. However, MTN lacks a method to measure the service availability\nfor long periods of time. The lack of monitoring, risk identification and proactive\noptimization suggestions for availability severely restricts service development.\nNow, the optical availability assurance solution has been applied to the MTN\nproject in Nigeria. Through the multi-dimensional evaluation and analysis for\nfiber and service availability, fiber cut impact and service protection risks, this\nsolution proactively identifies potential risks of fiber service availability, monitors\nservice availability in real time, automatically generates warnings when\nthreshold-crossing occurs and provides optimization suggestions. In this way,\nrectification can be performed in advance to realize a highly reliable network\nwith zero-fault.\nService closed loop\nBased on the internal collaboration of service, performance, and resource\nmanagement systems, the multi-domain decision-making capability is enhanced, and\nAI is introduced to drive multi-domain closed-loop management and support automated\nservice operations.\nBusiness closed loop\nWith the network capabilities provided by the intelligent management and control\nsystem at the resource operations and the operation support capabilities provided by\nthe service operations, the business operations provide customers with e-commerce\nand self-service experience, including online service subscription, bandwidth on\ndemand and real-time service SLA performance query, customers can enjoy self-\nservice network management services anytime and anywhere.\n© TM Forum 2023.

In addition,\nthe MTN Group will continue to work with industry partners to innovate in the direction\nof network intelligence, build smart self-healing networks featuring self-configuration,\nself-recovery and self-optimization, accelerate the development of the digital economy,\nand achieve business success.\n4.3.6. MTN：Fault Management-Closed Loop Automation\nA key challenge in operation was resolving complicated cross-domain faults where the\nproblem could be in the RAN, Core, TRX or IPRAN. When such problems are\ndetected, the staff has to collect data manually from various sources and need experts\nin various fields to do the analysis. Demarcating the fault can take hours and finding\nthe root cause can take days depending on the complexity of the problem.\nTo overcome this challenge, a Closed Loop Automation use case was implemented in\nthe Intelligent Fault Management (iFM) module of the OSS platform called AUTIN. As\nshown in the diagram below the idea is to take people out of the loop and let the\nplatform leveraging on AI resolve the issue through self-healing.\nFigure 45: Cognitive closed loop\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 75 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nArchitecture and Solution\nFigure 46: Architecture and Solution\nThe diagram above shows the 4 stages of the cognitive closed loop automation which\nare described below:\n• Awareness: The group of tasks that monitor and understands what happened\nor about to happen in quality/state of network/services. It collects multi-\ndimensional data from all domains such as RAN, Core, TRX, MW etc. and can\ndetect network quality degradation based on dynamic threshold monitoring\nmodel.\n• Analysis: The group of tasks which analyze information generated in the\nawareness phase using technologies such as AI inference for topology\ngeneration and cross-domain alarm correlation to demarcate where the\nproblem lies. For analysis it has various capabilities such as single domain fault\nidentification and cross-domain (power and environment) fault identification\nmodels. Topology can be generated for both mobile and fixed networks and\nreduces problem demarcation from hours to less than 5 mins.\n• Decision: The group of tasks that decide the necessary management operation\nfor execution e.g., network configuration or adjustment. Here it leverages on\nvarious diagnosis trees such as fault root cause diagnosis model and\nperformance degradation diagnosis model for RCA (Root Cause Analysis).\nCurrently these diagnosis trees cover 70% of network problems with an RCA\naccuracy of 90%.\n• Execution: The group of tasks which executes the management operations\nand feedback the result. Where configuration changes are required to resolve\nthe problem, the platform can make many of the changes by itself without\npeople intervention. This means self-healing or zero touch for these scenarios.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 76 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nImpact of Closed Loop Automation\nFor MTN this use case improved its network availability by between 0.05% and 0.1%. It\nalso reduced MTTR and revenue loss. The topology generation with its auto-discovery\nfeature enabled visual trouble shooting and faster fault demarcation. The AABD\n(Automatic Alarm Behavior Discovery) functionality supports root cause alarm\nidentification for cross-domain and complicated faults, and the open APIs supports\nMTN’s Autonomous Network journey.\nAn example of a value for MTN was in RAN sleeping cell detection. Previously MTN\nhad to do manual inspection to identify sleeping cells which can take more than 3 days.\nWhen the use case was implemented in one of the Opcos which had over 100,000\nlogical cells covering 2G/3G/4G the faulty cells were detected immediately and\nresolved remotely through self-healing which reduced the annual revenue loss. By\n2023 MTN is expected to implement this use case in all 20 Opcos covering over 300\nmillion subscribers.\n4.3.7. MTN：Digital Quick Optical Distribution Network\nAutonomous Networks is core for the Fiber To The x (FTTx) business strategy, and\nOptical Distribution Network (ODN) is the foundation of FTTx solutions. The Digital\nQuick ODN (DQ ODN) automation solution enables infrastructure resource\ndigitalization, operation efficiency and service experience improvement. For traditional\nODN solutions, the ODN network is manually managed, and the CSPs have no\nvisibility of the resources and topological information. With the DQ ODN solution, the\nresource layer managed the digitalized resource and topology, and the service layer\nmanaged the online provisioning, capacity expansion, and fault management service\nArchitecture and Solution\nFigure 47: FTTx Autonomous Network with Digital Quick ODN\nThe Digital Quick ODN solution is implemented based on three innovations: pre-\nconnected optical cable design, Innovative image algorithm and Optical Iris technology.\nWith the implementation of the DQ ODN solution, FTTx Autonomous Network is\nachieved through:\n© TM Forum 2023.

This\nmoves us a step closer to evolving to a higher-level of autonomous network operations.\n4.3.8. Hitless Automatic Upgrade of 5G Core Network NEs\nIn the 5G era, various industries are undergoing rapid digital transformation and posing\nnumerous requirements, which in turn is triggering more frequent version upgrades.\nTraditionally, these upgrades are performed frequently at the NE level, which interrupts\nservices, affects user stability, and hinders innovation and service development. During\nNE upgrades, users are re-registered or re-activated, and data and voice services are\ninterrupted, affecting user experience. The following are key challenges:\n• Complex upgrade process – an upgrade involves complex preparations and\nprocedures and many manual operations. Leading carriers usually have\nhundreds of sites, and upgrades can be performed only at night.\n• Long interruption during upgrades – before an upgrade, users must be\nmigrated (or pooled). Otherwise, services will be interrupted. It takes 15 to 20\nminutes to activate and upload software and restore services.\n• All resources required for hitless upgrade – all resources need to be\nreserved for hitless upgrade, resulting in wasted resources.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 78 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nSolution and benefits\nTo overcome these challenges, Huawei proposed an innovative hitless automatic\nupgrade solution for 5G core network NEs. This solution leverages automatic\norchestration, automatic rolling upgrade, and other capabilities to simplify the long and\ncomplex traditional upgrade process, achieving single-domain autonomy and closed-\nloop resource operations on core networks. The approach is shown in Figure 48\nfollowed by an explanation of how it works.\nFigure 48: Hitless automatic upgrade solution for core network NEs\nAutomatic orchestration – a workflow orchestration engine performs flexible scheduling\nto remove manual breakpoints and automate the entire core network NE upgrade\nprocess. The core network software package can be downloaded on a centralized GUI\nin one-click mode. Risks can be automatically checked, and the upgrade can be\nautomatically performed, significantly reducing risks caused by manual misoperations.\nAutomatic rolling upgrade – NEs are deployed based on the stateless design and\nmicroservice architecture to ensure compatibility with user data of multiple versions\nand allow instances of multiple versions to coexist. The internal network topology is\nshielded, and services on peripheral devices are not affected by the upgrade. 5G core\nNEs are divided into three modules from bottom to top: basic service platform, data\nand link service and business service. Each module is upgraded in rolling mode\n(migration > upgrade > migration), in batches.\nThe hitless automatic upgrade solution for 5G core network NEs ensures that users\nremain connected during the upgrade. Services are not interrupted, and peripheral\ndevices are not affected by the upgrade. No additional resources are required, and\nservice rollout is accelerated, laying a solid foundation for the rapid development of 5G\n• Zero service interruption – services are hitlessly upgraded in batches for all\nusers on the live network. User data is automatically synchronized, and the\ndata formats of the earlier and new versions are automatically regenerated to\nmeet new service requirements.\n• Zero manual operations – the entire upgrade process is automated to deliver\na zero-touch experience.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 79 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\n• Zero additional resources – NEs are deployed based on the distributed\nmicroservice architecture, and no additional resources are required for the\nupgrade.\nApplication and promotion\nThe hitless automatic upgrade solution for 5G core network NEs has been deployed in\nvarious provinces in China, including Zhejiang and Henan. In 2023, the solution will be\nreplicated across China on a large scale. L4-oriented grayscale verification will be\ndeveloped to implement daytime upgrades.\n4.3.9. Intelligent Cloud Core Network O&M\nThe core network is the brain of the telecom network and is responsible for scheduling\nand managing global network resources. The core network serves a large number of\nusers and has a wide impact scope in case of faults. Therefore, stability is a top priority\nfor the core network. 5G all-cloud core networks are being rapidly deployed and are\nseeing large-scale commercial use. These networks have introduced NFV, slicing, and\nMEC technologies. Core networks are becoming increasingly complex and are\nwitnessing a 100-fold increase in the number of maintenance objects, and increasingly\nfrequent change operations. Traditional manual operations cannot meet new O&M\nrequirements and face the following fault management challenges:\n• Pre-event: Network anomalies are difficult to monitor, and faults are passively\ndetected.\n• In-event: Cross-layer and cross-NE fault demarcation is difficult. Faults\ncontinue to create more negative impacts.\n• Post-event: No ground is provided for DR switchovers. Unnecessary DR\nswitchovers may cause even more service failures.\nTo overcome these challenges, carrier A and Huawei jointly developed an intelligent\ncore network O&M solution. Based on the intelligent engine and expertise, a complete\nfault management scheme is provided at the management and control layer to\nimplement proactive fault prevention, quick fault handling, and lossless fault\nrectification, fully improving core network reliability.\n• Intelligent fault detection: Various machine learning algorithms are used to\ninfer the dynamic threshold ranges of KPIs for anomaly detection, shortening\nthe detection time from several hours to just 5 minutes. The anomaly\nidentification accuracy reaches over 85%. The troubleshooting mode is\ntransformed from complaint-driven passive O&M to proactive prevention based\non prediction.\n• Intelligent fault diagnosis: Noise reduction, correlation, and aggregation are\nperformed for abnormal KPIs, logs, and alarms in order to comprehensively\nanalyze fault information in terms of space and time, and efficiently demarcate\nNFV cross-layer and horizontal issues. Faults can be demarcated at the\nminimum recoverable unit level within 10 minutes, significantly shortening the\ndemarcation duration and saving time for DR operations, if any.\n• Intelligent DR assistance: To tackle major core network faults, optimal\nparameter solving based on AI flow control and signaling impact simulation are\nused to quickly evaluate a DR switchover. Faults can be rectified within 15\nminutes, ensuring a successful DR switchover at one stroke.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

The solution has\nbeen piloted and verified in many provinces in China, including Henan, Jiangsu, and\nZhejiang. The test results show that the solution can greatly improve the efficiency and\nintelligent level of core network troubleshooting, helping the carrier reach AN L3 and\nevolve towards L4.\n4.3.10. Wireless Network – Intelligent Fault Management Based on Prediction\nIntelligent wireless network fault management happens in three stages:\n1. Automatic ticket processing, which significantly improves maintenance\nefficiency\n2. Proactive maintenance based on prediction and prevention technologies\n3. Providing a highly reliable self-sensing and self-healing mobile network\nfeaturing intelligent O&M based on advanced perception capabilities and\nvarious technologies, including intent-driven and level-based collaboration.\nMost CSPs are at the first stage, but pioneering CSPs are developing automatic\ntroubleshooting capabilities and shifting their focus to intelligent troubleshooting. In\nrecent years, many have posed requirements on the scope of fault prediction capability\nin terms of many aspects, from strategic indicators to platform capability development.\nThis is because wireless networks have always faced issues such as potential fault\npoints, various fault symptoms and complex fault causes (hardware, software, external\nsystem, environment and human factors), and a combination of active and passive\nfaults (such as passive fronthaul, power and environment, and device faults). They also\nuse different fault-detection methods and granularities and have complex onsite\ntroubleshooting and inspection operations. These issues create daunting challenges to\nthe development of intelligent wireless fault capabilities, such as precise identification,\ndemarcation and locating, troubleshooting and inspection and prediction.\nPredictive and proactive O&M\nHuawei has proposed a wide range of solutions based on the AN architecture with\nIntelligentRAN to overcome these challenges and facilitate the evolution towards\nAutonomous Networks. These solutions enhance the fault detection capability to\nmaximize the fault management scope while also achieving the optimal automation\nresult through upper-layer and lower-layer collaboration, cross-site collaboration and\ndevice-network collaboration.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 81 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nTake the equipment high temperature prediction solution as an example. NEs self-\ndetect the temperature data of each piece of equipment in real time, self-predict the\ntemperature trend within a short period at the NE level and report the trend to MAE.\nBased on long-term data of multiple sites, MAE uses the neural network deep learning\nalgorithm to generate a baseline AI model. Next the model will be generalized and\noptimized for each site or region to perform single-site inference in order to obtain the\noptimal prediction result and identify risks of high temperature.\nThe prediction capability can also be used in other scenarios, such as identifying risks\nof optical modules and paths. Based on the long- and short-term perception data of\nMAE and NEs, the subhealth status of optical components and paths can be predicted\nand determined.\nIntelligent AR inspection In the “last mile” practice based on device-network\ncollaboration, augmented reality (AR) technology is applied to site devices. Image\nrecognition technology and device-network collaboration enable automatic AR\ninspection, dumb resource modelling and real-time fault point identification. An\nintelligent wizard-based engine for troubleshooting is developed on MAE to\ncommunicate with site devices in real time to help site personnel perform efficient and\naccurate operations, greatly improving onsite troubleshooting efficiency.\nFigure 50: Equipment high temperature/optical power prediction solution\nFigure 50 shows the solution, and a more detailed explanation follows.\n• Automatic equipment room self-inspection based on image recognition –\nthe inspection scope covers 11 types of items and 25 sub-scenarios (such as\nequipment room door locks, batteries and grounding surge protection), and 9\ntypes of problems (such as battery rust and warranty period). Engineers can\nquickly take pictures and inspect equipment rooms, improving single-site\ninspection efficiency and ensuring that no inspection items are missed.\n• Proactive risk self-elimination assisted by knowledge library – inspection\npersonnel automatically check alarms and performance of devices based on\ninspection rules. Abnormal incidents can be handled by referring to the online\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 82 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nknowledge library of MAE. Alternatively, they can call experts for support in\none-click mode, greatly improving the efficiency of equipment room inspection\nand troubleshooting.\nBenefits\nThe equipment high temperature prediction solution has yielded satisfactory results in\nChina and Thailand. The accuracy of predicting high board temperatures five days\nahead reaches more than 90%. Possible causes and troubleshooting guidance are\nprovided. Early troubleshooting significantly lowers the risk of base station being out-of-\nservice due to high temperatures.\nThe AR site inspection solution has been verified in many provinces and cities in\nChina. The solution can be used to read almost all dashboards and other items that\nneed to be read by human eyes in wireless equipment rooms, reducing the inspection\nduration from 70 minutes to 30 minutes compared with traditional methods. The AR-\nassisted troubleshooting prototype solution reduces mean time to repair of fronthaul\nfaults for onsite troubleshooting verification in typical scenarios.\n4.3.11. Wireless Network - Dynamic Near-Real-Time Optimization\nWireless networks change with the passage of time. There are changes from many\naspects, including the radio environment, traffic volume, network load, user locations,\nand service experience. The frequencies of these changes are different, for example,\nlong-term monthly and weekly user growth, daily and hourly tidal traffic changes,\nminutes-level emergencies, and seconds-level and milliseconds-level service\nexperience deterioration.\nFigure 51: Dynamic changes of wireless network traffic over time\nDynamic network changes, especially those that happen within a few minutes or\nseconds, create tremendous challenges to network O&M. When an unexpected\nnetwork event occurs, traffic converges quickly, and the usage of air interface\nresources increases rapidly, resulting in complaints from cell edge users due to the\ndeterioration of user experience. If such an event occurs, the experience of specific\nusers is reduced to a level lower than that specified in the SLA, affecting the\nexperience of the entire service. It is difficult for O&M personnel to quickly monitor and\nrespond to network or experience changes that occur within a few minutes or seconds.\nThese frequent network changes are averaged in periodic and regional monitoring\nresults. The impact of these changes on user experience cannot be quickly perceived.\nIt may take one or two hours for data collection, root cause analysis, and closed-loop\ndecision making after a complaint is received.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 83 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nTo address these issues caused by dynamic network changes, intelligent capabilities\nare introduced to mobile networks. Based on Huawei IntelligentRAN architecture,\nwireless NEs collaborate with MAE to quickly detect changes, and adaptively adjust\nand optimize networks.\nSolution\nTo adapt to dynamic network changes, an intelligent network needs to provide quasi-\nreal-time optimization capabilities, including:\n• Network-level near-real-time perception and prediction of network performance\nor experience changes.\n• Near-real-time optimization and closed loop for burst traffic or experience\ndeterioration.\nThe solution consists of three parts: time modeling, network-level near-real-time\nperception and prediction, and near-real-time optimization and closed loop.\nKPI change feature extraction and time series modeling: Network KPIs, such as\ntraffic, resource usage, and throughput, of each cell change with the passage of time.\nNetwork data within a certain period can be collected to extract the features of long-\nterm and short-term changes in order to develop a cell-specific time series model that\ncan predict KPI changes.\nNetwork-level near-real-time perception and prediction of network or experience\nchanges: The time series model for network KPI changes and computing power can\nbe leveraged to automatically identify burst traffic or experience deterioration on the\nentire network. The identification result can be immediately reported to the upper-layer\nmanagement and control node. Collaborative intelligent identification at the network\nand NE levels in the intelligent architecture achieve minutes-level and seconds-level\nnear-real-time prediction when compared with the traditional monitoring mode. Based\non the short-term trend, KPI trends can be predicted to identify network or experience\nrisks.\nNear-real-time optimization and closed loop of burst traffic or experience\ndeterioration: Problematic cells and correlated cells are quickly identified to provide\noptimization solutions (including MLB parameters, multi-frequency camping and\nmobility parameters, RF beam parameters, and power control scheduling parameters)\nbased on the topology, scenario analysis, and model technologies.\nBenefits\nIn Tianjin, shopping malls and pedestrian streets are located in business districts, and\nresidential areas are located in adjacent districts. Traffic is concentrated in different\nareas in different time segments (shopping malls and pedestrian streets during the day,\nand residential areas at night). Based on the traffic changes predicted by the time\nseries model, SSB beams of 5G cells are dynamically adjusted to increase the traffic\nvolume and number of users by 5% to 10%, while ensuring that the KPIs remain\nnormal.\nIn the university and industrial areas in Shandong province, traffic changes dynamically\nin industrial parks, urban villages, hospitals, residential areas, and secondary\nvocational colleges in different periods. After dynamic optimization of SSB beams in 5G\ncells, the traffic and number of users increase by 5% to 10%, while ensuring that the\nKPIs remain normal.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

Intelligent Locating of Optical Path Interruptions Within Milliseconds\nAutomatic and intelligent O&M for all-optical networks has always been an industry\nfocus and a daunting challenge. The transport network is crucial to all-optical networks:\nAny fault with the transport network will affect numerous services and a large number\nof customers.\nLine interruption is a common transport network fault. For example, a municipal\nsubsidiary had 3,234 tickets for transport network faults in a month, among which\nabout 50% were ETH_LOS optical path alarms. Rectifying line faults is expensive and\ntime-consuming with a mean time to repair (MTTR) of about four hours.\nRectifying optical path faults involves three main challenges:\n• It is difficult to perform fault demarcation and locating due to many potential\nfault points, including power and environment, equipment rooms, optical\nmodules, optical fiber pigtails and optical cables.\n• The traditional method for locating optical signal LOS alarms on a peer device\ncannot accurately identify the root cause (for example, power failure, optical\ncable interruption or connector disconnection).\n• Precision must be compromised to improve the efficiency of centrally analyzing\na large amount of KPI data (for example, optical power data).\nSolution\nTo better predict optical path risks and accurately locate optical path interruptions, an\nunnamed CSP and Huawei jointly developed the millisecond-level intelligent optical\npath interruption locating solution. This solution provides millisecond-level optical\npower sensing capabilities for NEs, AI model optimization, and network topology-based\nend-to-end demarcation and locating capabilities. It can quickly detect and accurately\nlocate optical path interruption faults, improving O&M efficiency. The solution\narchitecture is shown below, and a description follows.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

Based on the AI capabilities of NE boards and the\nlarge data scale, the AI model for identifying optical path interruptions is\ncontinuously optimized to accurately identify optical path interruptions caused\nby power failures, pigtail disconnection and optical cable interruption.\n• Single-domain autonomy and cross-domain collaboration – the optical\nmodule of an NE collects data and caches data within a short period. The edge\nAI module of the main control board of the device performs local analysis to\ndemarcate and locate the causes of interruption at the NE level. The NMS\nidentifies single-domain faults based on the network topology and automatically\nstarts fault demarcation and locating, achieving single-domain autonomy. Key\ndata in the demarcation and locating result is reported to the upper-layer\nsystem to enable cross-domain collaboration.\nBenefits\nThis solution has been piloted and verified on networks in many provinces, including\nHenan and Guangdong. A full 77% of faults can be located within just a few minutes\nwith an accuracy of 95%. The average troubleshooting efficiency is improved by 30%.\nThe troubleshooting efficiency of frontline and second-line maintenance personnel is\nalso significantly increased, reducing unnecessary site visits.\n4.3.13. AI-Intellectualized O&M management\nTraditional ways of handling O&M are facing many challenges including opaque\nsystem rules, inconsistent data management, fragmented business processes, slow\ndemand response and high development costs. It is urgent to build an O&M capability\nplatform and apply AI to realize full lifecycle management of business processes,\nautomation processes, agile development and self-service.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 86 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nArchitecture and solution\nThe architecture for the AI-intellectualized O&M management solution, shown in Figure\n51, has several goals:\n• Extracting the common capabilities of electronic O&M systems, substitute\nmaintenance systems and materials management systems\n• Building an AI capability support system for O&M management with unified\nprocesses and users and data integration\n• Realizing end-to-end penetration of O&M workflows Improving the efficiency\nand intelligence of O&M work scheduling\n• Providing cross-layer and cross-domain process self-monitoring and self-\nservice for all business systems in the OSS domain.\nFigure 54: AI Intellectualized O&M management solution\nThe AI-intellectualized O&M management solution realizes automation and intelligence\nof O&M in the following ways:\n• Visualized fault closed loop – when a fault event is triggered, the processing\ngroup/ personnel and all task lists to be executed are automatically matched\naccording to the scheduling process configuration. The task can be presented\nquickly to realize the visual closed loop of the work order and fault self-\nmonitoring.\n• Intelligent work order quality inspection – analyzes the assessment intention\nof the manager and completes mass work order quality inspection through\nintelligent methods with AI training instead of manual. It promotes the\nstandardization of fault handling process and improves the efficiency of O&M\nmanagement from the perspective of the authenticity of fault recovery and the\nnormalization of work order response.\n• Automatic patrol inspection of network management – analyzes the\nintention of patrol inspection objectives and scenarios, automatically selects the\ncorresponding operation plan and completes the distribution to realize the\nunified management and scheduling of cross-domain and cross-integrated\nnetwork management intelligent patrol inspection.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 87 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\n• Resources patrol inspection with AI – completes a series of operations such\nas “scanning, target identification, photo uploading and compliance detection”\nthrough AI capabilities including video scanning and identification and helps\nO&M personnel conduct paperless and standardized patrol inspection during\nthe work. The patrol inspection records can be uploaded to the server in real\ntime for future reference, and the resource data can be automatically retrieved\nand verified according to the resource situation.\nApplication and outcome\nThis solution has been tested and verified in the O&M management of Anhui Mobile,\nSichuan Mobile, Hunan Mobile, China Unicom Group and other provincial operator,\nwhere is has improved O&M efficiency and ANL.\n• The intelligent quality inspection method has been deployed and applied in\nwireless, transmission, data, and other fields. The coverage rate of intelligent\nquality inspection is 99%, and the accuracy rate of intelligent quality inspection\nreached 95%.\n• The quality inspection efficiency is reduced from 9 people per month to 1\nperson per month. The intelligent quality inspection capability of fault work\norders has been deployed in AI mid-platform. The AN level of work order quality\ninspection reached L3 in Q4 2021. The demander can directly invoke it.\nNowadays, the average number of invoking per month has reached 454,000.\n4.3.14. Intelligent Automatic Verification of Dumb Resources Based on AI\nTechnology\nDumb resource management is the vital and difficult task of resource operation and\nplays a decisive role in resource management. The dumb resources refer to the\nnetwork element resources that cannot be automatically collected by the operation and\nmaintenance system. In simple terms, they are resources which cannot ’speak’ and\nhave no initiative. The amount of dumb resource data is huge and cannot be\nautomatically collected, and the accuracy of dumb resources seriously affects the\nplanning and construction, business scheduling, business monitoring and other service\noperations, and then affects the user's experience and business operation and\nmaintenance procedure which penetrates the network domain, operation and\nmaintenance domain and business domain.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 88 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nFigure 55: Intelligent Automatic Verification of Dumb Resources Based on AI Technology\nIn order to manage dumb resources and change the phenomenon that the input of\nresource data is inconsistent with the actual situation on the site, it is necessary to\nestablish a centralized resource management system, which is relied on the production\nprocess of various resource management such as embedded network and inventory\ncheck, and collect immediate resource data and longitude and latitude dot photos on\nthe site with the intelligent APP. The resource information will be stored into database\nand archived only after the audit by backend.\nThe resource audit has become a very important work in the current dumb resource\nmanagement. There are many issues about the accuracy which is judged by manually\ncomparing with the on-site photos and data in the current audit stage:\n• The Innumerable work orders make the audit pressure enormously: the\nnumber of dumb resources in a certain province of China Mobile is nearly 150\nmillion, the monthly average audit work orders is more than 10000, and the\naverage monthly audit pictures are more than 100000. At the same time, the\naudit work should be embedded in production, and the audit time limit is short,\nso these factors result in enormous audit pressure.\n• Due to relying on manual audit, the audit standards are not unified: dumb\nresources cannot be automatically collected, and their accuracy must be\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 89 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nchecked by audit. However, the audit work is still conducted manually, lacking\nthe intelligent methods.\n• Irregular on-site photographing procedure make great difficulty in review:\nthere are a large number of nonstandard or false photos in on-site\nphotographing, which makes it more difficult for the backend review, resulting in\na large number of invalid inputs and affecting accuracy.\n• Large demand for audit personnel and low audit coverage: due to lack of\nautomatic method to improve efficiency, and many ineffective inputs, the gap of\naudit personnel is large, so we can only spot check according to the proportion\nand cannot fully cover all dummy resources.\nAccording to the current situation of dumb resource management, the steps of\n\"establishing standard, intelligent audit, embedded production, automatic audit,\nanalysis and optimization\" dumb resource collection and verification are proposed, and\na new dumb resource management system of intelligent and automatic verification\nshall be established.\nEstablishing on-site image collection specifications: according to the standard\nspecifications of resource on-site image collection, add image acquisition verification in\ndumb resource on-site APP to effectively guide on-site construction personnel.\nBuilding AI intelligent audit capability: composed the AI capability of the intelligent\nmid-platform and the self-built two-dimensional code identification capability and build\nup AI intelligent audit methods such as on-site resource type identification, name\nidentification, location comparison and two-dimensional code identification.\nEmbedded AI capability in production & automatic audit: combined with AI\ncapability and automatic audit model, audit and control the scenario processes of\ncentralized resource creation, cutover, error correction and inventory inspection, it can\neffectively reduce the workload of manual audit.\nAnalysis and Optimization: provide statistical analysis report of collector portrait,\nwork order automatic audit and picture AI intelligent audit. The personnel are assessed\nand analyzed through the portraits, and the on-site photographing problems are\nsummarized through the analysis of the AI intelligent audit results. The photographing\nspecifications are optimized according to the problems, forming positive closed loop.\nThe solution has been put into practice in China Mobile's branches in many provinces\nand achieved remarkable results. Taking a provincial branch as an example, after the\nintelligent automatic verification of dumb resources was launched, the audit efficiency\nwas significantly improved, and the labor cost was reduced. The AN level can reach L4\nin the related rating.\n• There are 15,000 monthly audit work orders in this province, the automatic\naudit success rate can reach 90% + after deploying the Intelligent Automatic\nVerification System of Dumb Resources. There is an average of 1000 times per\nday for invoking AI identification capability of smart mid-platform, 3000 times\nper day for invoking OCR capability, and 2000 times per day for invoking QR\ncode identification.\n• The audit time of single work order is shortened from 180s to 60s, and the time\nconsumption is reduced by 66.67%.\n• 438 hours of labor hours can be saved every month, 5255 hours per year, and\n93.33% of audit labor can be reduced.\n• The coverage rate of resource verification is 100%.\n© TM Forum 2023.

End-to-end Cross-layer Network Fault Location Solution\nBased on NFV(Network Function Virtualization), the core network is constructed on\nthree layers (application layer, virtual layer and physical layer) and multiple VNFs share\nthe resource pools. Service fault location is more complicated than that of traditional\ndevices. In general, network faults have the maximum ratio, the greatest impact, and\nthe greatest analysis difficulty among service faults. So rapid delimitation and location\nof network faults has become a key point for troubleshooting in the NFV architecture.\nCross-layer diagnosis and analysis of network faults are very difficult, and have the\nfollowing challenges:\n• Unclear Network Topology: Complicated and dynamic network topology is\ncaused by network virtualization, and visual network topology is not available.\n• More Potential Fault Points: VM -> Virtual NIC -> Virtual switch -> Physical\nnetwork interface ->TOR/EOR switch -> router. Longer traffic forwarding path\nincreases fault points and it is more difficult to delimit the faults.\n• Difficult to Implement Traditional Packet-capturing: Unclear topology and\ncomplicated types of faulty protocols, and packet-capturing is too difficult to\nimplement.\n• Lack of End-to-End Location Method: The existing network fault location\ntools only support single-layer fault location without inter-layer end-to-end fault\nlocation measures crossing application layer, virtual layer, and physical layer.\nEnd-to-end cross-layer network fault location solution integrates the fault location\ncapabilities of three layers under the NFV architecture. From the application layer top-\ndown, it breaks through the capability barriers of each layer, and integrates the fault\ninformation of each layer, so as to realize fast cross-layer fault delimitation and\nlocation. This solution achieves closed loop at the resource layer in CN autonomous\ndomain and supports the service layer to achieve closed loop of services. In this way,\nself-monitoring, self-reporting, and self-analysis capabilities are improved in an all-\nround way, and the core network can achieve self-intelligence network of L3. Figure 56\nshows the architecture of the end-to-end cross-layer network fault location solution.\nFigure 56: Resource operation\nThis solution comprehensively improves zero-touch and zero-fault from O&M\ndimension through four in-depth analysis methods of \"three-layer network visualization,\n© TM Forum 2023.

By rendering alarms based on the topology graph, faulty nodes and\npossible network paths can be found rapidly to assist in locating network faults.\n• Fault Detection: Ping addresses of network and application in real time to\ndetect the disconnection, packet loss, and to detect potential network faults.\n• Fault Delimitation: By tracing IP packets, the system can collect statistics on\nIP packets and render them, and then analyze the traffic in the resource pool at\nthe minute -level granularity to help implement fast fault delimitation.\n• Fault Location: Provides automatic and intelligent packet capture capabilities\nfor troubleshooting. Through one-click generation of packet capture paths and\none-click delivery of packet capture instructions, packet capture can be\nimplemented efficiently and reliably, and faults can be rapidly located.\nThis solution has been verified in many networks (China mobile, China Unicom,\nChina Telecom etc. ) and has been used for commercial purpose. The verification\nresults show this greatly improves O&M efficiency of network troubleshooting.\nü Resource Panorama: Displays distribution and connection relationships of VNFs,\nVMs, HOSTs, network devices and links in the resource pool.\nü 5-minute Fault Delimitation: In the complex traffic model scenario, fault\ndelimitation duration is shortened from 60 minutes to 5 minutes, covering above 90%\nof the cross-layer faults.\nü 10-minute Fault Location: Efficient and intelligent packet capture, and efficiency\nis improved more than 90% as compared with traditional mode.\nü Improve Self-intelligent Network Level: Improve self-intelligent network level,\nand advance CN O&M towards L3.\n4.3.16. 5G Preventive Maintenance of Ultra-high-pressure Dense Corridor\nAnhui whole territory ultra-high-voltage line 2627 km is the only way to transport load\ncenter of East China with clean energy in the west. It is also the \"big artery\" and\n\"highway\" sent by East China Electricity in the west.

China Mobile: Green and Intelligent Optical Cross-Connect ( OXC )\nNetwork\nDevelopment of services such as 5G, cloud and “eastern data and western computing”\n, as well as customers’ demands for green energy saving and zero-wait ANs,\ntransmission network nodes face unparalleled challenges in capacity, energy saving,\nlatency and autonomy. At the same time, the traditional optical switching solution\noccupies a large amount of cabinet resource, fiber patch cords between cabinets and\nmuch energy. Therefore, a new optical technology solution is badly needed. To meet\nthe low-latency and intelligent O&M requirements of premium private lines, CSPs must\ngreatly accelerate the deployment and expansion of optical paths to achieve single-day\nservice provisioning and intelligent assurance.\nSolution\nOXC supports single-domain autonomy and enables resource closed loops. The\ncompany pioneered the adoption of multi-dimensional, all-optical OXC technology on\nintelligent transmission NEs to accelerate single-domain autonomy, save energy and\nenable intelligent O&M. In addition, network capabilities are open to enable agile\nbusiness. OXC replaces the traditional optical-to-electrical conversion, thereby\nachieving high integration, low-energy consumption, zero fiber connection and\nsimplified O&M. In addition, the network architecture is optimized (Meshnet), leading to\na significant decrease in latency and increase in transmission network quality (see\nFigure 58).\nFigure 58: Architecture of a green and intelligent OXC network\nApplication and benefits\nOXC lays a green, autonomous, all-optical foundation for the development of premium\nprivate lines. It reduces the space needed for transmission devices by up to 90% and\ncuts their energy consumption by 60%, respectively, with no fiber connection at sites.\nIn terms of transmission latency, it forms a 10ms latency circle around cities, facilitating\nmore efficient operations of premium private lines.\nProvincial branches such as China Mobile Jiangsu have joined hands with Huawei to\ndeploy the OXC technology. This move helps them save space amounting to 216\noptical-layer and 42 electrical-layer standard transmission racks in their transmission\nbackbone equipment rooms. For the 34 optimized nodes, China Mobile Jiangsu\nestimates its energy savings to be 1.3 million kilowatts a year, with a 45% reduction in\nenergy consumption.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 94 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nBy adjusting the network structure, the operating company effectively reduced the\ntransmission latency, with intra-province transmission latency cut by 33%. This ensures\nthe quality and experience of 5G private networks and transmission private lines and\nbuilds a solid technical foundation for Autonomous Networks.\n4.4.2. China Mobile: Dynamic Energy Saving With Slicing Packet\nNetwork(SPN)\nIn 2021, China Mobile’s energy consumption costs were 36.878 billion Yuan ($5.4\nbillion), and the transmission network accounts for about 5%-10% of the total. China\nMobile is developing the SPN for 5G slicing of the transport network, which will reduce\nenergy consumption.\nService volume on the SPN transport network gradually increases with continuous\ndevelopment of enterprise private line services. Service traffic changes with time and\nshows an obvious tidal effect: there is a large difference in loads between peak and off-\npeak hours.\nHowever, the energy consumption of network devices does not change when service\nloads vary. Instead, they always consume energy at full load, resulting in unnecessary\nwaste. CSPs must find ways to formulate dynamic energy-saving policies and properly\nset energy-saving parameters in order to implement refined and dynamic adjustment of\nenergy consumption while ensuring network experience. Service KPIs must not\ndeteriorate in energy-saving mode, but the energy consumption of the entire network\nneeds to be reduced.\nSolution\nWorking with Huawei and ZTE, China Mobile built an AI system to accurately forecast\nlink traffic trends based on historical traffic data, network topology, and service routes.\nThis system collects network data in real time, models traffic-burst patterns, intelligently\nanalyzes service load changes, and automatically generates multi-layer\n(chip/module/board) multi-mode energy saving solutions (see Figure 59). This makes\ndynamic energy saving a reality.\nFigure 59: AI platform for dynamic energy saving\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 95 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nApplication and benefits\nThe solution has been piloted in provincial subsidiaries such as China Mobile\nGuangdong. On the premise that service KPIs do not deteriorate, this solution achieves\ndeeper shutdown and longer energy-saving periods. The average energy consumption\nis reduced by 15% to 18%. During the pilot application, the system has been proven\nefficient and reliable in various scenarios including Children’s Day, Dragon Boat\nFestival, China National College Entrance examination and even natural disasters\ncaused by huge floods.\n4.4.3. China Mobile: Facilitating Low-Carbon Operations of State Grid\nCorporation of China\nIn Anhui, China, the ultra-high-voltage line covers 2,627km and is the only way to\ntransport clean energy from western China to eastern China. Traditional inspection of\nthe electricity transmission line has many disadvantages:\n• Ultra-high voltage (UHV) lines, remote areas in the field, and long line mileage\nmake it difficult to reach.\n• Guaranteeing the security of inspection personnel is difficult, and manual\nmaintenance is inconvenient.\n• Substations and power distribution rooms are widely located, and the cost of\noperations, administration, and maintenance (OAM) is high.\n• The manual OAM of the power grid is inefficient, and it is easy to make\nmistakes.\n• 24-hour inspection is needed in some special scenarios.\nSolution\nBased on China Mobile’s BAF atomic capability (the company’s BAF business model is\na multi-dimensional, 5G dedicated network business model based on “Basic network +\nAdvanced value-added functions + Flexible personalized services”), China Mobile\nAnhui is building a 5G private network for the State Grid of China. The solution\ncombines a dual-network integration mode for the 5G private network and the power\ngrid communication network, applying the 2B Smartlink one-stop service solution from\nZTE to provide precise network planning and 3D modelling and simulation of the 5G\npower distribution intelligent O&M service (see Figure 60).\nFigure 60: 2B Smartlink 5G closed-loop management in the full lifecycle\n© TM Forum 2023.

The\nsolution also provides closed-loop management throughout the full lifecycle of network\nplanning, deployment, maintenance, optimization and operation to meet service\nrequirements and implement 3D OAM of UHV line and fine management of services.\nSystem data and public resource data such as meteorological and hydrology data are\nconnected through the 5G private network. Various types of OAM and monitoring data\nare converged, and an intelligent OAM platform that monitors the full status of UHV\nlines is formulated, improving power scheduling efficiency and achieving accurate\nelectricity power distribution.\nBenefits\nManual OAM of the UHV line costs 2 million Yuan ($293,000)/person annually. The\npredicted cost saving will reach 1.8 million Yuan ($263 million)/person. With the\nsharing of power towers, 1 million Yuan ($146,000) per unit can be saved in\nconstruction cost of towers. CSPs’ 5G private network and unique 5G slicing\ntechnologies can be used to flexibly ensure QoS. Compared with traditional private\nlines, wired access, and 4G networks, the cost and deployment speed are reduced by\n50%, and the reliability is greatly improved to promote establishment of BAF network\nservice.\n4.4.4. China Mobile： “Smart Cooling” Intelligent DC Cooling Solution\nWith the rapid development of the global digital economy and the continuous digital\ntransformation of industries, the demand for and the construction scale of data centers\nin the world are increasing year-on-year. As a result, the energy consumption of data\ncenters accounts for more than 1.3% of the global energy consumption. The energy\nconsumption of the cooling facilities in the DC center is around 30%.\nTherefore, effectively reducing the energy consumption of the cooling system and\noptimizing the power usage effectiveness (PUE) value is important for China Mobile to\nrealize low-carbon innovation, reduce costs and increase efficiency.\nThe traditional PUE optimization mode of data centers mainly depends on O&M\npersonnel. There are two limitations:\n• Limited expert optimization effect: Whether O&M personnel has energy\nconservation optimization experience has a great impact on the final\n• Long optimization period: Tens of device parameters are involved. It is\ndifficult to find out the software optimization scheme quickly by manual\nstatistical analysis methods due to more than 1,000 parameter combinations in\nIDC air conditioning systems.\nThe DC PUE Smart Energy Saving Solution adopts the architecture and concept of\n\"autonomous optimization, Cloud-Premise collaboration, and continuous iteration\". It\nintroduces technologies and systems such as automation, AI intelligent platform, and\nRPA, which adopts multi-index time-space series prediction and deep neural network\nalgorithms, actively predicts the subsequent operating conditions and air-conditioning\nenergy consumption according to the historical data of outdoor temperature and\nhumidity, which comprehensively improves the capability of \"autonomous closed-loop\nenergy-saving and self-evolving model\". The DC cooling system is optimized and\ncommissioned to achieve the effect of \"fully automatic, short cycle, and more energy-\nsaving\".\n• Automatic closed loop of energy saving: (1) The resource layer\nautomatically collects the operating parameters and status data of cooling\ndevices through the group control system. Energy-saving configurations are\n②\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 97 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\nautomatically delivered and executed. The DCIM at the service layer\nautomatically performs energy-saving configuration reasoning. The RPA\nautomatic robot implements seamless interconnection between systems of\ndifferent vendors. The group control system automatically delivers and\nexecutes energy-saving configurations. The energy -saving optimization is\nself-iterative, the policy updating period is set, and the parameters of the water\ncooling system are optimized quickly by ③multiple iterations, to achieve the\noptimal energy saving state. Visualized energy-saving effect.\n• Automatic energy-saving model evolution: Cloud- Premise collaboration\n④\nimplements automatic update and closed-loop of DC energy-saving models.\nData samples are automatically collected and uploaded to the cloud-based AI\nplatform, and models are automatically retrained. Automatically delivers th①e\nupdated model to the local DCIM to implement continuous self-evolution of the\nenergy-saving model. ②\nFigure 61: The DC PUE Smart Energy Saving Solution\nCompared with the traditional expert mode, the DC PUE intelligent energy-saving\nsolution has higher optimization efficiency and better energy-saving effect. After the\npilot application in China Mobile Anhui, the energy consumption of data center\nrefrigeration is further reduced by 8%-15%. An estimated electricity saving of 220\nmillion kWh per year will be achieved after broader adoption.\n4.4.5. Base Station Online Energy Saving\nAs CSPs' network energy consumption keeps increasing, reducing the energy\nconsumption of the main equipment is key to delivering energy savings. Reducing the\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 98 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\npower consumption of the main equipment at wireless sites has become the top priority\nfor all.\nThe network traffic volume varies greatly during peak and off-peak hours. Despite this,\nthe equipment keeps running, and the power consumption is not dynamically adjusted\nbased on the traffic volume, resulting in energy wastage. In a typical network, the\nfeatures of different scenarios vary greatly. How we automatically identify different\nscenarios and formulate appropriate energy-saving policies becomes the key to energy\nsaving.\nThe solution involves providing automation capabilities for the service management\nlayer and resource management layer. Based on network-level AI-based intelligent\nenergy saving policy management and site energy saving scheduling control, the\nmobile network energy saving solution implements network scene adaption, one site\none policy, and multi-network collaboration for intelligent base station energy saving\nmanagement. This maximizes network energy saving benefits while ensuring stable\nnetwork performance and achieves the optimal balance between energy consumption\nand KPIs.\nFigure 62: Online energy saving solution\nThe solution focuses on wireless single-domain and collaborative analysis of cross-\ndomain data. The overall solution is as follows:\n• Data Self-awareness: Automatically obtains network data from the resource\nmanagement layer (radio domain) through scenario-based open APIs, including\nengineering parameters, MR measurement data, historical performance KPI\ndata, and neighbor relationships. It automatically obtains other data that may\naffect energy consumption from the service operation domain, e.g.,\nmultidimensional data such as weather and specific events.\n• Data Self-analysis:Based on big data analysis, AI technologies are adopted to\nautomatically identify network energy saving scenarios, predict network traffic\ntrends, such as traffic busy/idle hours and areas, traffic/energy consumption\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 99 of 105\nIG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0\ntrends, identify multi-cell co-coverage, and automatically generates energy\nsaving policies.\n• Policy Self-adjustment: real-time monitoring of impact on network KPIs and\nenergy saving benefits is implemented to achieve human visualization and\nmanagement of energy saving benefits on mobile networks.\n• Policy Self generation and Self-execution: The system automatically delivers\nenergy saving policies and implements network-level intelligent energy saving\npolicy management and coordinated management and control of site energy\nsaving scheduling.\nApplication and Performance\nIn typical network configurations, the power consumption of base stations can be\nreduced by 10%–15%, and the emission of about 2 million kg carbon dioxide can be\navoided for every 1000 base stations in one year.\nThe RAN element management system (EMS) can automatically identify different\nscenarios and optimize energy saving policies for different networking modes and\nloads, maximizing network energy saving benefits while ensuring KPIs. The overall\nenergy consumption is reduced by 13.59%. The average shutdown duration is 9.88\nhours, which is a 57% improvement compared with that when the feature is manually\nenabled. The tidal effect is obvious in office buildings, business centers, large\nstadiums, suburban areas, and county-level areas. The average energy consumption is\nreduced by 16.88%. Globally, online energy saving solutions can help save CSPs 100\nmillion kWh of power every year.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

SDOs make good\nprogress in defining the business architecture, technical architecture/API, and best\npractice sharing. The AN realization methodology continues evolving and becoming\nmore mature. The industry makes progress in defining AN levels and effective\nindicators from a business and user experience perspective. In all four categories\n(Enable Verticals, Customer Experiences, Business Growth, Efficient O&M, and Green\nEnergy), many use cases are implemented in the operator’s real networks. The\nmethodology and practices from leading CSPs summarized in this document help\naccelerate the AN realization of other CSPs.\nAs leading CSPs will achieve L3 of AN in 2023 in specific domains, we expect more\nexcellent use cases and best practices to emerge. We will continue to refine,\nsummarize, and update relevant experience and reflect the key technologies,\ninteroperability standards, and commercial cases of higher AN level.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Introduction\nTM Forum members, working in the Autonomous Network collaboration project, have\npublished a series of best practice guides and standards on autonomy and\nautonomous networks. This guide catalogs the published standards from this project.\nIt also lists planned guides or documents currently in development or in review.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 5 of 22\nIG1260 Autonomous Networks Project Deliverables Guide v3.0.0\n2. What is the Autonomous Networks Project?\nThe journey from automation to autonomy is both a business and a technology\nchallenge that requires some straightforward implementation and integration patterns\nto achieve self-governing autonomous networks. These concepts and patterns need to\nbe agreed upon and adopted by all stakeholders in the larger AN ecosystem. TM\nForum has created the Autonomous Networks collaboration project to begin this work.\nAs stated in the AN Vision guide (IG1193), Autonomous Networks will:\n1. Provide fully automated Zero-X (zero-wait, zero-touch, zero-trouble) innovative,\ncritical network/ICT services for vertical industries users and consumers.\n2. Support Self-X (self-serving, self-fulfilling, and self-assuring) network/ICT\ninfrastructures and services for enabling the digital transformation of vertical\nand telecom industries through the full lifecycle of operations.\n3. Offer disruptive services for innovative user experience, mission-critical\nservices based on fully automated lifecycle operations and self-organizing,\ndynamic optimized resources.\n4. Comprise a simplified network architecture, virtualized components, automating\nagents and intelligent decision engines to create intelligent automated\nbusiness/network operations for the closed-loop of new digital business.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Getting Started\nThe table below lists the leadership team for the AN project and also the project\nworkstreams.\nProject Role Name Company\nProgram Director Aaron Boasman-Patel - VP, AI and TM Forum\nCustomer Experience\nProject Manager Alan Pope, Collaboration Manager TM Forum\nSubject Matter Expert Dave Milham, Chief Architect TM Forum\nProject Sponsor Christian Maître, Orange Orange\nWorkstream Leaders\nAN Business Dong Sun, Chief Business Transformation Futurewei\nArchitecture Architect\nAN Technical Kevin McDonnell, Senior Director, Intelligent Huawei\nArchitecture Automation\nTEOCO\nYuval Stein, AVP Technologies\n3.1. Business Architecture workstream\nThe Business Architecture (BA) workstream focused on business requirements and AN\nframework - and as such represents the business need and solution to end-users and\nCSPs. It is developed per the AN Vision (IG1193) and define the overall business\nrequirements, services, framework, AN levels, key business capabilities, E2E full\nlifecycle of AN operations and provides example use cases to illustrate the usage of\nAN. It serves as an input to the detailed work in the Technical Architecture (TA)\nworkstream, as well as the baseline to the regularly published AN white paper and the\nSDO industry collaboration efforts.\n3.2. Technical Architecture workstream\nThe Technical Architecture (TA) workstream details how the TM Forum AN Framework\ncan help realize these future autonomous networks. The AN TA builds upon the AN\nFramework (while also leveraging other TMF frameworks as ODA, eTOM, SID, and\nOpen API program) to propose an evolutionary path toward the mechanisms that are\nrequired to deliver a layered architecture (operational layers and autonomous\ndomains), one that decouples integration complexity (intent) and leverages autonomic\nclosed control loops to realize self-operating capabilities.\n3.3. AN Multi-SDO Collaboration\nAutonomy and autonomous systems are complex areas and the industry needs\nstandards to guide on the best way to achieve autonomy and ultimately deliver on\nAutonomous Networks vision. Ideally, these standards should fit well together and form\na coherent whole. Several standards developing organizations (SDOs) have been\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

The principles are varied: some are\nhigh level to guide solutions design, whereas others address more granular issues regarding\ncontextual, cultural, and pragmatic aspects of an implementation.\nThe document is intended as a complement to the AN business architecture[ref 10] and\ntechnical reference architecture [ref 11]. The AN business architecture takes a top-down\ncustomer-oriented approach, whereas this document considers the broader set of business\nand operational drivers that will need to be considered when adopting an AN. The AN\ntechnical architecture provides a technical reference architecture on which to base a solution\ndesign, whereas this document focuses on some of the pragmatic operational aspects of a\nsolution. Both the business architecture and technical reference architecture cover the AN\nlevels of autonomy, whilst this document outlines observability requirements for an AN\nsolution more broadly.\n© TM Forum 2020.

Page 10 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n3 Introduction\nThe words \"autonomous network\" (or indeed \"autonomous <anything>!\") prompts many\nquestions!\n• How will they work?\n• What will they cost?\n• Will humans be needed at all in the future!?\n• If there are few (or no) humans involved what happens when the Autonomous\nNetwork (or AN for short) degrade and/or fail?\n• How will the AN know when it is failed?\n• How do we know that the AN will be fair and equitable to all customers, partners, and\nusers?\nNo one has definitive and detailed answers for all these [and many other] practical\nquestions. What is clear, however, is that networks with level 5 autonomy are still quite a long\nway off. Until they exist the AN consists of teams of humans and machines collaborating to\ndeliver and sustain services. This collaboration is very important to secure successful business\noutcomes and is discussed later in this document.\nTelecom is not the first sector to embrace autonomy, and so it is possible to learn and infer\nfrom experiences in other sectors, such as manufacturing, automotive, and shipping (see\nreferences 1-5). Research into these learnings has resulted in a set of categories of relevant\nguiding principles for AN, summarized by category in Appendix I, which are explored in the rest\nof this document.\nFigure 1 Guiding Principles (Categorized)\nThe following chapters will describe the principles belonging to the categories. The numbers in\nthe Figure 2 AN Guiding Principles corresponds to the section it is covered in.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved.

Page 12 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n4 Business Drivers\nThe drivers for AN will vary from CSP to CSP, but fundamentally they are not so different to\nthe drivers of any type of commercial production operation. A CSP is also a production\noperation, producing connectivity and connectivity related services. Using general economic\ntheory 4 factors of production as a basis the factors of production are depicted in Figure 3.\nFigure 3 General economic theory: factors of production, and production model\nProduction processes generally make use of capital and labor to convert raw materials into\nfinished products, and inevitably there is some amount of waste which impacts profitability.\nFigure 4 CSP Factors of production, production model\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\nApplying the same logic to the CSP: the production process converts energy into ICT services,\nusing network and IT infrastructure and the people who operate them, as depicted in Figure\n4. If all of the engineered network capacity is not used, then there is also waste. These\nsimplified production models essentially set out the main levers that an organization has to\nchange business outcomes. They can expand their channels to market via various ecosystems,\nwhich should reduce unused capacity, but this requires the production model to\ntransform. Many companies in manufacturing industries have already transformed by\nadopting technologies (e.g. industrial robots) and created highly automated flexible\nmanufacturing engines. ANs can transform the CSP production model in the same way,\nincreasing resource utilization and energy efficiency, and creating network services tailored to\ncustomer needs.\nAlthough all operations processes are similar in that they all transform inputs, they do differ in\na number of ways, four of which, known as \"the four Vs\" according to ref[6], are particularly\nimportant:\n● the volume of their output\n● the variety of their output\n● the variation in the demand for their output\n● the degree of visibility which customers have of the creation of their output.\nAll four dimensions have implications for the cost of creating and delivering services and\nproducts. Put simply: high volume, low variety, low variation, and low customer contact all\nhelp to keep processing costs down. Conversely, low volume, high variety, high variation, and\nhigh customer contact will generally carry a cost penalty for the operation. This is best\nillustrated with the \"operations typology\" chart used in ref [6], as depicted in Figure 5.\nFigure 5 Operations typology - the 4 Vs\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 14 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\nDifferent CSPs will have varying ambitions on each of these \"V\"s according to their business\nstrategy, all with their own trade-offs. The AN must allow a CSP achieve the appropriate level\nof \"V\" for each market segment, or even partner or customer (if required). Analyzing any of\nthe main public cloud service providers through these \"V\" prisms its evident they have\ndesigned their platform and products to:\n• be very high volume if required, and, critically, without a corresponding increase in cost\n• provide a reasonable (but not infinite) amount of variety\n• provide great ability to handle variations in demand (scale up, scale down)\n• provide acceptable visibility through the use of APIs and intelligent agents(bots)\nThese are good baseline targets for a CSP also.\nAn operation contributes to business strategy by achieving the following performance\nobjectives:\n1. Doing things right, resulting in a quality advantage\n2. Doing things fast, resulting in a speed advantage\n3. Doing things on time, resulting in a reliability (or dependability) advantage\n4. Changing the things that are done, resulting in a flexibility advantage\n5. Doing things cheaply, resulting in a cost advantage\n6. Focusing on the customer, resulting in reputation and brand advantages that enable\npricing power versus the competition\n7. Keep doing things in times of adversity, resulting in a business continuity advantage\nThe commercial success of AN should be judged using all of these objectives, and thus they\nshould underpin the principles used when designing and implementing an AN solution.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 15 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n5 Business Driver Principles\nEvery CSP is different, and so are their precise business drivers. Thus principles 1-7 below will\napply in different amounts to each customer. As described in ref [10] and ref[11] these are\nexpressed with intent, at customer, partner, business, and service and network operational\nlayers, and the role of the AN will be to reconcile and resolve the conflicts, both initially and on\nan ongoing basis.\n5.1 Scope\nEverything within the AN shall not need to be fully (or even partially) autonomous, it may not\nbe justified from a business perspective. This is an overarching principle to remind us that its\nextremely unlikely (or even infeasible) that every single part of the CSP business will be fully\nautonomous. In fact, in some cases, too much autonomous behavior may be\ncounterproductive, and create more issues than it resolves. Per ref[7] the performance of the\nhuman-machine system increases with the autonomy of the machine, but only until some\noptimum, after which it decreases. That is because if the autonomy of the machine is further\nincreased, the human operator is likely to lose control of the situation, and performance then\nregresses, as shown in Figure 6 below.\nFigure 6 Balance of Autonomy\nFurthermore, excessive automation tends to lower the level of vigilance of human operators of\nhighly automated systems, that is: the more intelligent a system is the more complacent the\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 16 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\nhuman operator becomes - this can also be counterproductive. Thus: not every function\nshould reach L5 autonomy.\nThis could be revisited when industry efforts have realized systems that are getting close to L5\nautonomy, this is not in the near term, however.\n5.2 Customer Experience (CX)\nCustomer experience shall, for most CSPs, be a key driving factor when considering and\ndeciding how autonomous a function or domain should be. The focus shall be on how\ncustomer is going to experience the product (or service) provided by the network and what\nhappens if and when it fails or degrades.\n5.3 Cost of Operation\nCost of sustainment (or cost to operate) shall drive the need to implement autonomous\nbehavior. Generally, functions that are more costly and onerous to operate should be\nprioritized over ones that are less costly. The AN shall help the CSP deliver products and\nservices at lower per unit costs, maximize the utilization of their assets, and minimize waste.\n5.4 Speed of Operation\nSpeed of operation shall drive the need to implement autonomous behavior. Functions that\nare slow, or that regularly become bottlenecks, are obvious candidates to target for some (or\nfull) autonomy. The AN shall help the CSP reduce execution times across all tasks and\ndisciplines: service design and creation, network rollout, service, network, and customer\nprovisioning, assurance, billing, rating, migrations, service retirement, etc.\n5.5 Reliability of Operation\nReliability (or dependability) shall drive the need to implement autonomous behavior.\nReliability means doing things in time so that customers receive the right set of products and\nservices exactly when they are needed, or at least when they were promised. Over the long\nterm being reliable translates into time and cost savings, improving the business reputation,\nand ultimately increasing future revenue potential. The AN shall help the CSP become more\nreliable.\n5.6 Quality of Operation\nQuality is consistent conformance to customers (and partners and regulators) expectations - in other\nwords \"doing things right\". \"Doing things right\" shall drive the need for autonomous behavior. In some\nway’s quality is the most visible part of what a CSP does from a customer perspective, and thus\nis related to guiding principle #1 because its often perceived(especially bad experience), but\nquality is about more than customer experience. The AN shall help the CSP deliver error-free\nproducts and services which are ‘fit for purpose’.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 17 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n5.7 Flexibility of operation to make changes\nFlexibility of operation shall drive the need to implement autonomous behavior.\nToday customers demand greater flexibility in the following ways:\n• product/service flexibility – ability to introduce new or modified products and services\n• product/service mix flexibility – ability to produce a wide range or mix of products and\nservices\n• volume flexibility – ability to change level of output or activity to support different\nproduct volumes, or capacities\n• delivery flexibility – ability to change the timing of delivery of services and products.\nThe AN shall help the CSP become more flexible to customers changing needs.\n5.8 Risk of Business Discontinuity\nRisk of business discontinuity shall drive the need to implement autonomous behavior.\nBusiness discontinuity can happen for several reasons; examples would be IT security attacks,\nor organizational competence gaps (e.g. due to CSP staff aging demography, or faster pace of\ntechnological change). The AN shall enable the CSP to have more robust business continuity\nplans and procedures.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 18 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n6 Observability\nTo see what is going on inside a system under observation, the system must be observable.\nThat is: there must be measures, or metrics, produced by the system that can be monitored\nexternally.\nAutonomy will be the metric used to translate to the autonomous levels mentioned in the\nbusiness architecture[ref 10] and technical ref architecture[ref 11]. If, for example, a network\ndomains autonomy is 100% (i.e. all activities are performed by a machine and no activities are\nperformed by humans) then this would translate to autonomous level 5. While the\nautonomous level is informative about the system capability in terms of autonomous behavior\nit is not the only measure needed to ensure a successful business outcome when using an AN.\nIn general, as a system gets more autonomous more (not less) observability data is needed to\nassure that everything is working correctly, and to better effect than traditional more manual\nmethods.\n3GPP observability focus has been on specific network performance indicators which, in most\ncases, were observed by humans. As autonomy levels increase machines will do more of these\nobservations, and take more decisions that, ordinarily, are taken by humans today. Thus:\nthese automated processes and the logic that drives them need to be more observable. A\ncandidate set of observability categories are outlined below. Note that these are not fully\nelaborated metrics and formulae.\nFigure 7 Observability\n6.1 Autonomy\nThe autonomy of a system is measure of its ability to make choices and enforce its\ndecisions. To have autonomy (or act autonomously) the system must have (1) intelligence\nand (2) capability, and these are both bounded, as shown in Figure 8. There is little or no\nvalue in building an extremely intelligent system that can make many choices independently if\nthe system does not have the capability to implement the choices.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\nFigure 8 Autonomy: Intelligence versus Capability\nTo use a simple example: take the case of a robotic lawnmower. These are excellent\nintelligent products for flat and undulating terrain, but their capability often limits their\nautonomy, and therefore utility. For gardens that are split level, or non-contiguous, for\nexample, the robotic lawnmower does not have the capability to autonomously move\nbetween one area and another - a human must intervene. The lawnmowers autonomy is\ntherefore bounded by its capability.\nThus: system autonomy is best measured as a function of what tasks and operations can be\ndone independently, and what requires human intervention. At a very simplistic level it would\nbe expressed as follows:\n′\n# 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 𝑂𝑂ℎ𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 𝑂𝑂 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑢𝑢𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑂𝑂𝑢𝑢𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂\n# 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂\nTo enable calculation of such a metric telemetry data is required\n• # operations (or tasks undertaken)\n• # operations that require human involvement\n• # operations that do not require human involvement\nThese should be available over many dimensions of analysis, such as: time of day, day of\nweek, user ID, domain, operation type, object type, attributes, object instance, vendor,\nsoftware version.\nWhen SON (self-organizing networks) were introduced by 3GPP in 2010 (and appeared in\ncommercial products subsequently) all configuration changes made by the network were\nlogged alongside human-applied configuration changes, thus it was, in theory, possible to\ncompute what % of configuration changes were made. A similar (but broader) set of\ntelemetry will be needed to measure broader network autonomy.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 20 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n6.2 Trust and Understandability\nFor humans to delegate many of their business and network operation responsibilities to a\nmachine they must trust the machine will deliver an equivalent (or even better) business\noutcome. Without that trust adoption of the AN will be a significant challenge. Trust depends\non mutual understanding, that is: a human must first understand the behavior of the AN\nbefore they can grow to trust it. The behavior and competence exhibited used by the AN\nmust be appreciated by humans for it to engender trust, and this must be consistent over\ntime. At a high level, trust can be simply defined as follows:\nMore practically there are three dimensions to trust that must be\n𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶\nconsidered:\n𝑇𝑇𝑂𝑂𝑟𝑟𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 = 𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶\nDependability: the belief that the system will do what it indicates it will do (or what business\npolicies indicate it should do). This largely pertains to metrics that already exist for service\navailability, reliability, and integrity, but would also include safety (no bad consequences for\nusers or the environment), encompassing confidentiality and security. Competence: the belief\nthat the system has the ability to do what it indicates it will do (or what business policies\nindicate it should do). It can be assessed by tracking how often (or not) a human agrees with\nwhat the AN is suggesting as a course of action. Each recommended course of action should\ncome with an explanation. Satisfaction with the explanation can be measured by collecting\nhuman feedback from the user interface. Integrity: the belief that a system is fair and just.\nThis relates to bias, and whether the system exhibits any form of bias towards customers,\ncustomer groups, partners, etc. This bias could be explicit (attitudes or beliefs expressed at a\nconscious level of awareness) or implicit. Human curiosity is also something that should be\nconsidered. That is: how do users interact with explanations. This can inform us on the quality\nof the explanations the system is providing, and whether the mental models used within the\nexplanations are appropriate for users.\nIdeally it should be possible to track\n• # suggestions made by AN\n• # user feedbacks provided on suggested made by AN (satisfactory and\nunsatisfactory)\n• # operations whose underlying logic and output can be accounted for\n• % operations of whose underlying logic and output can be accounted for\nAt a deeper technical level where AI is used AI model inputs and outputs should be tracked to\nidentity irregularities which may indicate bias within an algorithm.\n6.3 Deployability\nDeployability is a measure of how straightforward a system is to deploy. This could be\nmeasured in terms of deployment time (i.e. how long does it take) deployment success rate\n(i.e. is the deployment 100% successful, or does a human have to intervene to resolve some\nissues). Naturally when the network is autonomous these metrics should be (1) better than\ntoday’s more traditional deployment approaches and (2) continuously improving.\nThe following types of data would, at a minimum, be required from telemetry:-\n• Total time to deploy\n• Time deployment process had to be paused\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 21 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n• # associated work orders\n• # humans involved\n• # human operations involved\n6.4 Adaptability\nAdaptability is a measure of how good a system is at adapting to state changes, whether\ncaused internally, or via the external environment. Whenever major changes occur the AN\nwill, for some amount of time, go into a state of inequilibrium, where it is no longer\nsynchronized with the network. The goal is to return to a state of equilibrium as quickly as\npossible in order to remain in control. Measurements that matter are\n• Time in in-equilibrium: time in which the AN is adjusting to dynamic changes, and\ntherefore is not in complete control\n• Time to adapt: time taken for the AN to adjust to the above mentioned changes (e.g. ML\nmodels are retrained etc.). In control theory this is called “time to reach accuracy”\n• Time between adaptations: time between two adaptations, indicating how robustly the\nautonomous system (or function) is handling incoming network data. This is akin to a\nterm within machine learning, called 'performance drift'. Drift is about monitoring model\nKPIs to determine model performance, which may trigger a retraining process if drift has\noccurred. If incoming network data is dramatically different to the training data which the\nmodel has been created, then performance drift often will occur.\n6.5 Sustainability\nCSPs are significant users of energy and markets generally expect them to report on their\nusage and how they are reducing their carbon footprint. The AN should help the operator\nmonitor and actively reduce the power consumption and therefore CO2 emissions. The\nfollowing types of KPIs are relevant:\n• Energy Consumption\n• Energy Consumption by source (Fossil fuel, nuclear, solar, wind, EV battery)\n• Carbon Footprint (ktons of CO2)\n• Water consumption (for cooling systems, where applicable)\nAs examples two publicly quoted objectives from Telia and BT, per their annual reports:-\n• Telia: be Co2 neutral and zero waste by 2030\n• BT: reduce Co2 emissions by 87% by 2030\n6.6 Consumability\nOne of the main customer criticisms of CSPs today is that they cannot deliver services quickly\nand frictionlessly like cloud service providers. In contrast products and services offered by\ncloud service providers are very \"consumable\" : customers can easily select what they need,\nconfigure it, and it is available for use instantly, or, in the worst case, a few minutes\nlater. With cloud: services have been transformed into the equivalent of utilities. They can be\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 22 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\nturned on when you need them, and off when you do not. This is where CSPs need to get\nto.\nKey consumability metrics for a CSP will be\n• Time to find product\n• Time to order\n• Time to service consumption\n• Time to customize service\n• Time to modify service (e.g. increase or reduce capacity, add more branch offices, etc.)\n• Time to cancel\n• Number of human interventions required, per transaction (this should be zero, or close to\nzero, per cloud service providers)\n6.7 Resource Efficiency and Utilization\nThese metrics are not new for ANs but are very important comparatively. An AN should do\nmuch better here than a manually operated network, otherwise the business case for AN is\nnot as strong.\n6.7.1 Resource Efficiency\nMany operators talk about “production cost” or “production cost-per-bit”. The more resource\nefficient the network the lower the production cost. CSP will want to track how good the AN is\nat achieving efficiency gains versus a manually operated network.\nThe AN should be able to do more with less, e.g. if 100 CPUs costing $100K/month are needed\nto improve a process costing $90K/month by 15% that is not a good result!\nMetrics such as the following are relevant\n• CPU unit / MB consumed\n• Memory unit / MB consumed\n• kWH / MB consumed\n• <#human minutes expended> / MB consumed\n6.7.2 Resource Utilization\nThis is about understanding how good the AN is at achieving better resource utilization\nlevels. The metrics will focus on resource utilization across CPU, memory, radio frequency.\n6.8 Quality of experience\nSimilar to resource efficiency and utilizations QoE metrics are not new. The AN should deliver\nbetter customer perceived quality of experience (QoE) to all applications that use it, and it\nshould be comparably better than a network that is manually operated. This QoE should cover\nthe full lifecycle, using SLAs where required, covering\n• Time to order\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 23 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n• Time to set up\n• Service outage time\n• Time to modify\n• Time to repair (in the event of a service outage)\n• Standard technical QoS metrics associated with the applications\nAccessibility and access latency\no\nRetainability\no\nThroughput\no\nPacket loss\no\nLatency\no\n• Achieved QoS Rate: QoS is negotiated, customers often get less than they request\ntoday. This phenomenon should reduce with the AN based on better resource allocation\npolicies\n6.9 Observability Principles\n6.9.1 Observability\nAll components within an AN shall be observable. All domains (and functions within domains)\nshall produce appropriate data to support SLA monitoring\n• automated incident detection and alerting\n• analysis of system health (historical trends and analytics)\n• manual debugging - when necessary\n• “Appropriate data” includes Metrics (standardized and non-standardized performance\ncounters), KPIs (useful for analytics), Logs (useful for behavioral understanding and\nproblem determination purposes), Health check outputs (useful to understand health\nstatus of individual components), Tracing (useful for understanding control flow from one\ndomain (or function) to another).\nGiven that an AN is a heterogeneous environment interoperability in this area is important.\n6.9.2 AN key performance indicators\nNew dimensions of analysis shall be necessary to measure and evaluate the success of\nANs. New KPIs shall be specified as part of standardization efforts but nominally the output\nshall consist of the following KPI categories: autonomy, consumability, trust, sustainability,\nadaptability and deployability. Many existing KPIs will not change however it is expected AN\nshould improve KPI values over time.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 24 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n6.9.3 Traceability for audit purposes\nThe AN shall record all relevant data pertaining to the status of the network and its\ncomponents, and what events and incidents trigger it to act. This trace shall include\nreferences to the responsibility matrix, e.g.\n24/8/2020: user JamesOS approved ADN recommended action B to reset base station DublinRBS001A\nThese traces shall be archived for auditing purposes.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 25 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n7 Responsibility Principles\nAs with other sectors the subject of responsibility is an important one for autonomous\nsystems. There are often “gray areas” in this area that cause lots of controversy.\nSimplistically:\n• for an L0 AN system the human carries out all activities and therefore is 100%\nresponsible.\n• for an L5 AN system the network (or machine) carries out all activities and therefore is\n100% responsible. Idealistic perhaps, but mathematically correct!\n• Most networks are somewhere between 0 and 5 and thus responsibility is shared.\nThe challenge is the percentage of sharing in L1-L4 networks can be very dynamic, and it can\nbe very difficult to track. The following principles are outlined to help with the creation of CSP\nspecific situational awareness mechanisms.\n7.1 Responsibilities at first startup of AN\nUpon the first startup of the AN autonomous functionality shall be enabled, but not\nactivated2. In fact: it will be running in background to learn from human\n7.2 Machine and human responsibility\nOver time the AN shall independently improve consumability, performance, and efficiency in\nmost common situations however human intervention can be expected to be required for\nknowledge augmentation, judgement, decision making and execution, especially in ”corner” or\n“edge” cases\nHumans shall also perform ongoing monitoring, validation, and audit of the behavior of the AN\nand its constituent parts (domains)\n7.3 Responsibility awareness\nThe functions and tasks that remain under direct human responsibility must be clear to them\nat all times. The functions and tasks that are delegated to the AN must be evident to the\nrelevant human(s) at all times, as well as when the status changes.\nA dynamic responsibility matrix shall exist for each AN domain and function within a domain\n(e.g. PASCI or RACI - see definitions )\n2\nThis is a principle adopted by self-organizing networks (SON) when those capabilities were introduced in LTE.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 26 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n7.4 Assignment and removal of responsibility\n• A suitably authorized human can delegate and remove task responsibilities from the AN at\nany stage.\n• Delegation of tasks may fail (e.g. if the AN is not ready from a state management\nperspective).\n• Removal of responsibility shall not fail in general. However, to ensure the system remains\nin a consistent and safe state, some transactions may be completed by the machine before\nit can release responsibility.\n7.5 Responsibility handover\nIn the event the AN detects that it needs to hand over some or all overtake responsibility to a\nhuman\n• the handover reason(s) shall be clear\n• the AN shall request a confirmation that the human has accepted the handover\n• if no confirmation is forthcoming the AN shall take steps to secure a safe steady state\n(there may be some negative consequences), these steps would essentially be heuristics\nand predetermined rules that are appropriate to the specific scenario. In parallel use a\ndefined communication escalation path to inform appropriate staff that the handover has\ntaken place\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 27 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n8 Autonomy degradation and failure handling\nprinciples\nIf a function or system is autonomous the impact to business outcomes as a consequence of a\ndegradation and failure need to be extremely clear to all involved. In fact: some functions\nmay not be automatable at all if conditions around stability are too difficult to achieve during\ndegraded or failure conditions. The following state machine depicts the general business logic\nthat is needed to ensure stability.\nFigure 9 Rough AN business logic state machine\n8.1 Degradation of autonomous functionality\nIn the situation where autonomous functionality degrades the AN shall be aware of the\ndegradation, and report it, but shall still be capable of running the function at reduced\n[capacity/availability/etc.] levels whilst the degradation is triaged with the help of a human.\n8.2 Failure of autonomous functionality\nIn the situation the autonomous functionality fails, the AN shall be aware of the failure, and\ncontrol shall be reverted to a human. Procedures to revert the system or functionality to a\nconsistent known state shall exist and be understood by all.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 28 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n9 Behavior and Explainability Principles\n9.1 Indistinguishable behavior of AN from human operated network\n(analogous to a \"Turing test\" 3)\nThe AN shall exhibit behaviors that are consistent with manually operated networks so that all\nparticipants within an ecosystem can continue to seamlessly interoperate, as before.\nParticipants include\n• Mobile terminals (i.e. UEs)\n• Roaming partners\n• Internet exchanges\n• Interconnection exchanges\n• Cloud service providers\n• Vertical industries\nThe full or partial introduction of an AN shall be fully transparent to ecosystem participants.\n9.2 Adjusting behavior of an AN\nWhere “inappropriate” or “incorrect” AN behavior is detected the human shall have the ability\nto teach and help the network to adjust its behavior. The effect of the adjustment shall\ntypically be gradual.\n9.3 Explainable behavior\nThe behavior of the AN shall be easy-to-understand for [competent] humans\nThe AN shall be able to explain its behavior and decision making to [competent] humans in\nterms that they understand\n9.4 Predictable behavior\nGiven the same starting state and set of input events the AN [running a given set of software\nversions] shall always produce the same result.\n3\nNote 1: when ANs communicate to other ANs its highly likely the dialog can be more optimized once the initial preamble exchange takes place.\nNote 2: this is not intended to be an official Turing test as not all autonomous functions will be implemented using AI\n© TM Forum 2020.

The setting for \"high confidence\" would typically be set as a\npolicy by a human and would vary per use case and scenario.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 30 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n10 Principles of Human-Machine Interaction\n(HMI)\nHuman-machine interaction (HMI) is a crucial element for the safe and stable operation of\nANs. As it progresses up the autonomous levels the AN takes on more tasks and the human\ndoes less, being freed up to do more strategic work within the business. This often gives rise\nto the so-called “control problem” [ref 12,13], which is the tendency of the human agent\nwithin a human–machine control loop to become complacent, over-reliant or unduly diffident\nwhen faced with the outputs of a reliable autonomous system. To paraphrase it in logic:\nThe control problem occurs when:\n[ Machine automation fails OR degrades to a level that is problematic ]\nAND\n[ Human does not notice OR is incapable of taking over responsibility when needed ]\nNote that this problem is not unique to AI or ML powered automation, it applies to any type of\nautomation implementation.\nIf AN is 100% reliable in terms of delivering business outcomes then human supervision is not\nnecessary, and thus the control problem will not occur. The reality, however, is that very few\nautomation functions are 100% reliable so some human supervision is still needed. “Almost\n100% reliability” is actually the biggest issue:\n- Extremely high (but not 100%) reliability engenders complacency in humans, and they\noften switch off, which means they are not ready to take over if the machine\nautomation encounters an insurmountable problem\n- because the automation is so reliable humans do not get to practice many of the\nnormal day-to-day tasks that they performed in the past, thus they slowly become\ndeskilled.\nThe most important goal for the AN HMI is to secure the users correct interpretation of the\nnetwork status, and that they understand their responsibilities in the moment of a\nresponsibility transition.\nBased on research in other fields (military, aviation, shipping) [ref 13] the appropriate and\npractical ways to alleviate the control problem are\n- Ensure the human still has a meaningful and active role in “policing the automation”.\nThis may [counter-intuitively] mean using less reliable technical solutions in some\ninstances to instill greater vigilance in humans. The targeted scenarios may vary per\noperator, a needs analysis is needed as part of AN solution planning.\n- Introduce simulated accountability measures (so called “catch trials”) in which system\nerrors are deliberately generated to keep human invigilators situationally aware. This\ncould be quite useful in counteracting automation bias and has been quite successful\nin the autonomous shipping industry.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 31 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\nOn the first alleviation point a pragmatic role partitioning and collaboration strategy is\nrequired for each CSP. The general methodology put forward by Accenture principals in [ref 8]\nmay be a good starting point. Figure 10 is a slightly adjusted version adopted from the book,\nwhere the central six roles are where true collaboration between humans and machines take\nplace.\nFigure 10 Human machine collaboration activities\n“Train”, “explain”, and “maintain” are distinct roles that are relevant when dealing with AI or\nnon-AI based automation. The human only and machine only designations are based on who\nis better and more naturally suited to these items (at least currently – machines may advance\nin other areas in future).\nIn summary the AN HMI should be carefully designed to consider the psychological and\ncognitive traits and states of humans with the goal of optimizing the human’s understanding of\nthe current task/situation and of reducing incorrect system operation. It will not be one-size-\nfits-all, rather it will be self-adjusting to each CSP environment. Some related principles are\noutlined below:\n10.1 Human-machine interface – human-agent teaming\nThe AN HMI shall support flexible modes of human-agent teaming, whereby a human (or\ngroup of humans) and the network behave as equal partners on a team (but human\nintervention is still in place, obviously), and collaborate on goals where there is “shared\nsituation awareness” within the team. Shared situation awareness is knowledge about the\ncurrent state of the task environment, as well as team activities, team performance,\ndependencies, and overall progression with respect to the team task. Such knowledge shall\nfacilitate coordination and reallocation of tasks within the team but shall also be used for\neffective and efficient communication inside and outside the team members.\n10.2 \"Flight simulator\" mode\nAs the ANs gets increasingly automated there will be less work for the user to do (in terms of\ntraditional tasks at least). On a similar vein some parts of the network are increasingly reliable,\nand many error scenarios are not seen regularly, if ever! (i.e. extremely rare). The result of\nthese situations is that humans could become deskilled over time because they are not\nactively doing the work as they did in the past. The AN should support \"flight simulator\" style\ndrills in a sandbox or simulation environment to help them maintain their skills and prepare for\n\"chaos monkey\" scenarios that, generally speaking, would not normally be experienced. This\nalso helps address the control problem associated with all automated systems.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 32 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n10.3 User profiles to better optimize human:machine collaboration\nTo account for the fact that, just like the network, humans change over time (skills, abilities,\nconnections, etc.) and better enable human collaboration the AN should build targeted\nprofiles or annotations of users to understand their technical and operational competences,\nabilities, and strengths, and their workplace related “social” network. Such profiles are useful\nfor task/work allocation, ad hoc team formation, user behavioral analysis (to build strong\nmachine learning models, for example), and bias detection.\n10.4 Human-machine interface presentation of information\nTo [eventually] reach level 4 and 5 autonomous levels the HMI of the AN should generally only\ndisplay information for which a human consultation (or decision) is necessary. Presentation of\nunnecessary information [for the task at hand] should be avoided as much as possible to avoid\nhigh cognitive load on the human which ultimately negatively impacts decision making.\nNote: this may not be achievable from the outset, but it should be a goal, and there should be\na plan on how to achieve it\n10.5 Human-machine interface multi-modality (AN ↔ network operator\ndomain experts)\nTo cater for increased customer diversity and the ongoing trend in application mobilization the\nAN HMI shall cater for different usage and modes of interaction. The traditional telco “big\nscreen” model of network operations is not a suitable HMI for many enterprises, and majority\nof CSPs are mobilizing many of their systems. Where it makes practical sense and improves\nhuman-machine collaboration mobile and AI assistants shall be available for some applications\nand use cases. Removal of human bottlenecks\nBackground: In today’s network operations many things do not happen because humans fail to\ndo them, due to other work, absence, or some other reason. For example: the organizations\npriorities were incorrect because John was out sick this morning - he did not login and run the\nWireless status report.\nAll human bottleneck tasks should be found and delegated to the ANs, and the\nworkflow/process redesigned to ensure human bottlenecks are entirely removed.\nVendor product offerings should be evaluated on how many (or few) human bottlenecks their\nproducts introduce.\n10.6 Transformation of product documentation into digital knowledge\nassets\nHumans shall not need to refer to individual product documentation for daily network\noperations, the AN should inform them what they need to know in any given context\nProduct documentation concerning features, capabilities, and dependencies shall be\nmanifested as machine readable artifacts for use by the autonomous, which shall actively use\nthem as knowledge assets.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 33 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\nDocumentation concerning differences between network function product versions (software\nand hardware) shall be manifested as machine readable artifacts in order for use by the AN to\nactively use these facts as knowledge assets, removing painstaking and error prone\ninvestigation tasks from humans. Note: some traditional network node product\ndocumentation shall still have a role for network planners and technical staff involved in\nprocurement evaluation processes.\n© TM Forum 2020.

Page 37 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n13 Appendix I: AN Guiding Principles\nThe following table provides a short tabular view of the complete list of guiding principles.\nTable 1 Complete list of Guiding Principles.\n# Category Principle\n0 Business driver Scope\n“Everything“ within the AN shall not need to be fully (or even partially)\nautonomous, it may not be justified from a business perspective. This is an\noverarching principle to remind us that it is extremely unlikely (or even\ninfeasibly) that, pragmatically, every single part of the CSP business will\nnot be fully autonomous. In fact, in some cases, too much autonomous\nmay be counterproductive, and create more issues than it resolves. Per ref\n[7] the performance of the human-machine system increases with the\nautonomy of the machine, but only until some optimum, after which it\ndecreases. That is because if the autonomy of the machine is further\nincreased, the human operator is likely to lose control of the situation, and\nthings then regress, as shown on below.\nThe following will differ in priority for each CSP depending on the type, size, and goals of the\nbusiness\n1 Business driver Customer experience\nCustomer experience shall, for most CSPs, be a driving factor when\nconsidering and deciding how autonomous a function or domain should\nbe. The focus shall be on how customer is going to experience the product\n(or service) provided by the network and what happens if it fails or\ndegrades. Focusing on these scenarios shall drive out the right\nautonomous behaviors.\n2 Business driver Cost of operation\nCost of sustainment (or cost to operate) shall drive the need to implement\nautonomous behavior. Generally, functions that are more costly and\nonerous to operate should be prioritized over ones that are less costly. The\nAN shall help the CSP deliver products and services at lower per unit\ncosts, maximize the utilization of their assets, and minimize waste.\n3 Business driver Speed of operation\nSpeed of operation shall drive the need to implement autonomous\nbehavior. Functions that are slow, or that regularly become bottlenecks,\nare obvious candidates to target for some (or full) autonomy. The AN shall\nhelp the CSP reduce execution times across all tasks and disciplines:\nservice design and creation, network rollout, service, network, and\ncustomer provisioning, assurance, billing, rating, migrations, service\nretirement, etc.\n4 Business driver Reliability of operation\nReliability (or dependability) shall drive the need to implement autonomous\nbehavior. Reliability means doing things in time so that customers to\nreceive the right set of products and services exactly when they are\nneeded, or at least when they were promised. Over the long term being\nreliable translates into time and cost savings, improving the business\nreputation, and ultimately increasing future revenue potential. The AN shall\nhelp the CSP become more reliable.\n5 Business driver Quality of operation\nQuality is consistent conformance to customers (and partners and\nregulators) expectations - in other words \"doing things right\", \"doing things\nright\" shall drive the need for autonomous behavior. In some ways, quality\nis the most visible part of what a CSP does from a customer perspective,\nand thus is related to guiding principle #1, but quality is about more than\ncustomer experience. The AN shall help the CSP deliver error-free\nproducts and services which are ‘fit for purpose’.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 38 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n# Category Principle\n6 Business driver Flexibility of operation to make changes\nFlexibility of operation shall drive the need to implement autonomous\nbehavior.\nToday customers demand greater flexibility in the following ways:\n• product/service flexibility – ability to introduce new or modified\nproducts and services\n• product/service mix flexibility – ability to produce a wide range or mix\nof products and services\n• volume flexibility – ability to change level of output or activity to\nsupport different product volumes, or capacities\n• delivery flexibility – ability to change the timing of delivery of services\nand products.\nThe AN shall help the CSP become more flexible to customers changing\nneeds.\n7 Business driver Risk of business discontinuity\nRisk of business discontinuity shall drive the need to implement\nautonomous behavior. Business discontinuity can happen for several\nreasons; examples would be IT security attacks, or organizational\ncompetence gaps (e.g. due to CSP staff aging demography, or faster pace\nof technological change). The AN shall enable the CSP to have more\nrobust business continuity plans and procedures.\n8 Observability Observability\nThe AN shall be observable. All domains (and functions within domains)\nshall produce appropriate data to support\n• automated incident detection and alerting\n• analysis of system health (historical trends and analytics)\n• manual debugging - when necessary\n“Appropriate data” includes\n• Metrics (standardized and non-standardized performance counters,\nKPIs - useful for analytics)\n• Logs (useful for behavioral understanding and problem determination\npurposes)\n• Health check outputs (useful to understand health status of individual\ncomponents)\n• Tracing(useful for understanding control flow from one domain (or\nfunction) to another)\nGiven that an AN shall be a heterogeneous environment interoperability in\nthis area shall be important\n9 Observability AN key performance indicators\nNew dimensions of analysis shall be necessary to measure and evaluate\nthe success of ANs. New KPIs shall be specified as part of standardization\nefforts but nominally the output shall consist of the following KPI\ncategories: autonomy, consumability, trust, sustainability, adaptability and\ndeployability.\n10 Observability Traceability for audit purposes\nThe AN shall record all relevant data pertaining to the status of the\nnetwork and its components, and what events and incidents trigger it to\nact. This trace shall include references to the responsibility matrix (e.g.\nuser JamesOS approved ADN recommended action B to reset base station\nDublinRBS001A)\nThese traces shall be archived for auditing purposes.\n11 Responsibility Responsibilities at first startup of AN\nUpon the first startup of the AN autonomous functionality shall be enabled,\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 39 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n# Category Principle\nbut not responsible**. In fact: it will be running in background to learn from\nhuman\n** This is a principle adopted by self-organizing networks (SON) within\nwireless networks today.\n12 Responsibility Machine and human responsibility\nOver time the AN shall independently improve consumability,\nperformance, and efficiency in most common situations however human\nintervention shall still be required for\n• knowledge augmentation, judgement, decision making and execution,\nespecially in ”corner” or “edge” cases\n• monitoring, validating, and auditing the behavior of the AN and its\nconstituent parts (domains)\n13 Responsibility Responsibility awareness\nThe functions and tasks that remain under human responsibility must be\nclear to them at all times. The functions that are under the responsibility of\nthe autonomous must be evident to the relevant human(s) at all times, as\nwell as when the status changes.\nA responsibility matrix shall exist for each AN domain and function within a\ndomain (e.g. PASCI or RACI - see definitions )\n14 Responsibility Assignment and removal of responsibility\n• A suitably authorized human can assign and remove responsibilities\nfrom the AN at any stage.\n• Assignment of responsibility may fail (e.g. if the AN is not ready from a\nstate management perspective).\n• Removal of responsibility shall not fail in general. However, to ensure\nthe system remains in a consistent and safe state, some transactions\nmay be completed by the machine before it can release responsibility.\n15 Responsibility Responsibility handover\nIn the event the AN detects that it needs to hand over some or all over\nresponsibility to a human\n• the handover reason(s) shall be clear\n• the AN shall request a confirmation that the human has accepted the\nhandover\n• if no confirmation is forthcoming the AN shall take steps to secure a\nsafe steady state (there may be some negative consequences), and in\nparallel use a defined communication escalation path to inform\nappropriate staff that the handover has taken place\n16 Degradation Degradation of autonomous functionality\nand failure In the situation where autonomous functionality degrades the AN shall be\naware of the degradation, and report it, but shall still be capable of running\nthe function at reduced [capacity/availability/etc.] levels whilst the\ndegradation is triaged with the help of a human.\n17 Degradation Failure of autonomous functionality\nand failure In the situation the autonomous functionality fails, the AN shall be aware of\nthe failure, and control shall be reverted to a human. Procedures to revert\nthe system or functionality to a consistent known state shall exist and be\nunderstood by all.\n18 Behavior and Indistinguishable behavior of an AN (like “Turing test”)\nexplainability The AN shall exhibit behaviors that are consistent with manually operated\nnetworks so that all participants within an ecosystem can continue to\nseamlessly interoperate, as before. Participants include\n• Mobile terminals (i.e. UEs)\n• Roaming partners\n• Internet exchanges\n• Interconnection exchanges\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 40 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n# Category Principle\n• Cloud service providers\n• Vertical industries\nThe introduction of an AN shall be fully transparent to ecosystem\nparticipants\n19 Behavior and Adjusting behavior of an AN\nexplainability Where “inappropriate” or “incorrect” AN behavior is detected the human\nshall have the ability to teach and help the network to adjust its\nbehavior. The effect of the adjustment shall typically be gradual.\n20 Behavior and Explainable behavior\nexplainability The behavior of the AN shall be easy-to-understand for [competent]\nhumans\nThe AN shall be able to explain its behavior and decision making to\n[competent] humans in terms that they understand\n21 Behavior and Predictable behavior\nexplainability Given the same starting state and set of input events the AN shall always\nproduce the same result\n22 Human Human-machine interface multi-modality (Autonomous network ↔\nmachine network operator domain experts)\ninterface To cater for increased customer diversity and the ongoing trend in\napplication mobilization the autonomous network HMI shall cater for\ndifferent usage and modes of interaction. The traditional telco “big screen”\nmodel of network operations is not a suitable HMI for many enterprises,\nand majority of CSPs are mobilizing many of their systems. Where it\nmakes practical sense mobile and AI assistants, or conversational agents\nshall be available for some applications and use cases. The challenge is\nto support bidirectional transparency in real time, while not overwhelming\nthe human with too much information and burden\n23 Human Human-machine interface – human-agent teaming\nmachine The AN HMI shall support flexible modes of human-agent teaming,\ninterface whereby a human (or group of humans) and the network behave as equal\npartners on a team (but human intervention is still in place, obviously), and\ncollaborate on goals where there is “shared situation awareness” within the\nteam. Shared situation awareness is knowledge about the current state of\nthe task environment, as well as team activities, team performance, and\noverall progression with respect to the team task. Such knowledge shall\nfacilitate coordination and reallocation of tasks within the team but shall\nalso be used for effective and efficient communication among the team\nmembers.\n24 Human Human-machine interface presentation of information\nmachine To [eventually] reach level 4 and 5 autonomous levels the HMI of the AN\ninterface should generally only display information for which a human consultation\n(or decision) is necessary. Presentation of unnecessary information [for\nthe task at hand] should be avoided as much as possible to avoid\noverwhelming the human and negatively impact decision making.\nNote: this may not be achievable from the outset, but it should be a goal,\nand there should be a plan on how to achieve it\n25 Human Removal of human bottlenecks\nmachine Background: In today’s network operations many things do not happen\ninterface because humans fail to do them, due to other work, absence, or some\nother reason. For example: the organizations priorities were incorrect\nbecause John was out sick this morning - he did not login and run the\nWireless status report.\nAll human bottleneck tasks should be found and delegated to the ANs, and\nthe workflow/process redesigned to ensure human bottlenecks are entirely\nremoved.\nVendor product offerings should be evaluated on how many (or few)\nhuman bottlenecks their products introduce.\n© TM Forum 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 41 of 43\nIG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions\n# Category Principle\n26 Human \"Flight simulator\" mode\nmachine As the ANs gets increasingly automated there will be less work for the user\ninterface to do (in terms of traditional tasks at least). On a similar vein some parts of\nthe network are increasingly reliable, and many error scenarios are not\nseen regularly, if ever! (i.e. extremely rare). The result of these situations is\nthat humans could become deskilled over time because they are not\nactively doing the work as they did in the past. The AN should support\n\"flight simulator\" style drills in a sandbox or simulation environment to help\nthem maintain their skills and prepare for \"chaos monkey\" scenarios that\nwould not normally be experienced.\n27 Human User profiles to better optimize human:machine collaboration\nmachine To account for the fact that, just like the network, humans change over time\ninterface (skills, abilities, etc.) and better enable human collaboration the AN should\nbuild targeted profiles of users to understand their technical and\noperational competences, abilities, and strengths. Such profiles are useful\nfor task/work allocation, ad hoc team formation, user behavioral analysis\n(to build strong machine learning models, for example), and bias detection.\n28 Human Transformation of product documentation into digital knowledge assets\nmachine Humans shall not need to refer to individual product documentation for\ninterface daily network operations, the AN should inform them what they need to\nknow in any given context\nProduct documentation concerning features, capabilities, and\ndependencies shall be manifested as machine readable artifacts for use by\nthe autonomous, which shall actively use them as knowledge assets.\nDocumentation concerning differences between network function product\nversions (software and hardware) shall be manifested as machine readable\nartifacts in order for use by the autonomous network to actively use these\nfacts as knowledge assets, removing painstaking and error prone\ninvestigation tasks from humans\nTraditional network node product documentation shall still have a role for\nnetwork planners and technical staff involved in procurement evaluation\nprocesses.\nFigure 11 Guiding principles detailed\n© TM Forum 2020.

To ensure that their digital operating model\nis effective, organizations are integrating customer experience management as part of\nthe core elements across their organization. To enhance on developing an effective\ncustomer centricity capability, customer experience focus has been added to the\nAOMM operation flow as we assess and grow the maturity level of the service\ncapabilities.\nThe intent of this guidebook is to provide organizations with an objective approach in\nassessing their autonomous operation maturity level. With a clear understanding of the\ncurrent maturity level, organizations will be able to set their next level target along their\ndigital transformation journey towards operational excellence in aligning to their\nbusiness strategy. The objective approach will include:\n• Process mining technique in providing a process transparency to identify areas\nof optimization.\n• An AOMM model to provide a methodical step in classifying the autonomous\noperation capabilities and designing a service capability roadmap.\n• A value operation framework in quantifying and assessing the values through a\nlist of operation metrics.\nTo guide organizations in effectively measuring and managing their autonomous\noperations, a step by step best practice to a catalyst contributed scenario has been\nincluded as an illustration to pursue the ZTO journey.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 5 of 61\nGB1042B Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0\nIntroduction\nDigital transformation journey is in acceleration mode across all industries.\nOrganizations are rapidly transforming and building business capabilities across\nfunctions to realize their corporate strategic framework. The intent of this guidebook is\nto make use of the assets generated from the Catalyst contribution which includes the\nAutonomous Operation Maturity Model (AOMM) tool and an objective approach to the\nAOMM assessment for the Autonomous Network Level (ANL) process automation. The\nuse of ANL to formulate an impact on autonomous operations by way of improving\nprocess automation helped the CSP to establish a baseline and target state for its\nprocess automation. This helped to identify process automation capability gaps. The\nimpact analysis can support prioritization and re-prioritization based on business\nmotivation that is linked to the Value Operations Framework (VOF).\nThe champion's challenge statement of the Catalyst defined the requirement of having\na more objective approach to assess the current service capability maturity level, and\ntransparently identify areas of optimization driving towards ZTO. To realize the\ncapability development and value assessment of the digital transformation initiative, a\nminimum viable product (MVP) on VoLTE service quality monitoring to problem\nresolution was introduced and served as an illustration to guide the understanding of\nthe objective AOMM approach and value assessment. To execute the digital\ntransformation strategy, many organizations have adopted customer experience\nmanagement or customer centricity as a core element to their operating model. In\nshaping the operation model to align with the strategic framework, maturity assessment\nof the service capabilities related to customer experience management are considered\nin the operation flow.\nThe innovative asset generated from the Catalyst is the data and value driven\noperations that adopts the process mining technique which replays a process map that\nmapped against the ANL model to provide an objective assessment approach and\nenables identification of areas for process optimization.\nThe above provides concise text to help introduce the catalysts focus. This document\nis targeted at business decision makers and operations owners in the Communication\nService Provider industry and Enterprise undergoing digital operation transformations,\nas well as being of particular relevance to CTO, CIO, CMO, Head of Customer\nExperience Management, Head of Digital Transformation, Head of Networks\nOperation, Head of Network Operations Center, Head of Service Operations Center\ntogether with their architects, network planning, designers, customer care, customer\nexperience management, OSS and DevOps team from both IT and CT backgrounds.\nThis document will also position the TM Forums work on Autonomous Networks\nConcept & Framework, and Autonomous Network Realization Approach Framework in\nrelation to the Autonomous Operations project implementation and service capability\nroadmap planning in the solution's development moving forward.\n© TM Forum 2023.

The Catalyst Challenge\nThis TM Forum catalyst 22.0.387 focused on a challenge of service providers tackling\nincreasing OPEX and customer experience management shortfalls as network\nexpansion and sophistication brought scale and multi-class of service delivery to\noperations. Typically, CSPs need clear understanding of existing business capabilities\nin order to set milestone targets given knowledge of the gaps between AS-IS and TO-\nBE maturity levels. These gaps can then be analyzed from viewport of their operations\npain points, as well as the underpinning capabilities required in order to realize their\nambition. The challenges identified for the catalyst to address are covered in the\nfollowing section.\n1.1. Infrastructure Complexity\nCSPs are going through major infrastructure transitions to deal with increasing\nbandwidth demands from customers. While 5G networks are increasingly coming\nonline and expanding, CSPs still have to manage their 2G, 3G, and 4G networks too.\nIn addition, CSPs are also transforming their hardware-based network to virtualized,\nand software architecture to bring agility and improve service delivery. Besides, the\ntransition also includes integrating cloud model into a backhaul of telecom network, as\ncentral or edge cloud to raise scalability. With the co-existence of 4 network\ngenerations, virtualization and cloudification, the infrastructure is not only becoming\nmore complex, but also costlier to manage as it requires higher caliber talents who are\nkept updated with operation competence and knowledge. With the network grows in\ncomplexity, the operating cost can be contained by keeping the network reliable. This\ncan be made possible through service capability development in accelerating the\nmaturity level for autonomous operation.\n1.2. Increased Operational Expenditure\nIn a competitive telecommunications market, the telecommunications sector was firmly\nfocused on revenue growth rather than operational efficiency. However, the revenue is\nnot growing at a faster rate than the growing cost, forcing communications service\nproviders (CSPs) to focus increasingly on cost management and, more recently, cost-\ncutting.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 7 of 61\nGB1042B Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0\nFigure 1-1 Increased OPEX at the Peak of 2/3/4/5G Co-existence\nThe operating expenses (OPEX) are going to rise sharply during the 5G migration as\nthe legacy networks (2G/3G/4G) will continue to function in parallel with 5G for years to\ncome. Although 5G services could generate new revenue, the prevalence of legacy\nsystems and operational processes that aren't equipped to handle the increasing\ncomplexities of service and network operations would result in high consumption of\nbudgetary resources and process inefficiencies, which would eventually affect long-\nterm profitability and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization\n(EBITDA).\nCSPs will continue to struggle to provide high-quality services and maintain their\ncompetitive advantage if they rely on increasing headcount and skills to manage future\nnetworks, which is not sustainable in the long run. A new digital operating model is\nneeded to deliver service agility, significantly reduce OPEX and tackle the complexities\nof new foundational technologies.\n1.3. Necessity for new class of services\nService evolution has given a new dimension to end users' expectation where end\nusers may be non-human and that need communication loop to complete just in time\nand in rare situations just on time. Such a critical form of service delivery cannot be\nachieved if there is no end to end full automation with a high degree of accuracy.\nHence, automation becomes a basic foundational need for certain evolving services. It\nis not a desire but a necessity.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 8 of 61\nGB1042B Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0\nDelivering Digital Services Profitably with Excellent Customer Experience\nBesides focusing on OPEX reduction with network automation assisted with Artificial\nIntelligence/Machine Learning to gradually reduce costly and time-consuming legacy\npractices regarding service and network operations, it is also imperative for CSPs to\nshift their operational focus from the network toward customers and services to deliver\nsuperior customer experience. An excellent customer experience can help CSPs\ndifferentiate themselves from the rest of the competition, enabling them to realize\nbusiness value by delivering digital services profitably. A Temkin Group Study\nmeasured customer experience across 61 large tech companies using the Net\nPromoter Score (NPS) metric. It was found that even a moderate increase in NPS for a\ncompany with a $1B revenue resulted in an $823M increase in revenue over three\nyears (Theht).\nCustomers who are satisfied with the service will spend more than compared to the\nones who have had an unpleasant experience. The research report, \"Global Insights\non Succeeding in the Customer Experience Era,\" reveals that for telecommunication\nindustry, 49% of customers are willing to pay more for great customer experiences\n(O'Keeffe & Company, 2013).\nThis shows that by improving your customer experience offering, the company can\nincrease the Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). A high CLV means each customer will\nbring in more revenue for the company, maximizing the marketing Return on\nInvestment (ROI) and reducing the cost on customer acquisition to drive sales. Thus, it\nis important to develop capabilities in the customer experience management to provide\nenhanced and personalized digital services to develop a sustainable operating model\nin delivering digital services to their customers.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 9 of 61\nGB1042B Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0\n2. Reinvent Operating Model\n2.1. Winning Formula for Autonomous Operations\nThere is a need to have a digital operating model in approaching digitalization of their\noperations – meaning the use of technology to improve performance. The need to put\nin place a digital operating model that is sustainable for new levels of speed, agility,\nefficiency, and effectiveness. However, implementing new technologies should not be\nseen as a tick-box activity of isolated performance improvements, but rather as a vital\nnext step in the continuous quest to better address customers' needs throughout the\ncustomer journey to ensure sustainable competitiveness. The question is what would\nbe the capabilities an organization would need to build in order to support the digital\noperating model. The capabilities that are required to align operation to business in\nexecuting the digital transformation strategy effectively.\n2.2. Customer Experience Management\nTo enable the offer of a profitable and personalized digital service, it is imperative to\nbuild capabilities in the customer experience management that effectively integrate to\nthe organization and digital operation model. A customer experience is a journey or\namalgamation of interactions a customer or potential customer has with a business. It\nis how customers perceive the services offered by a service provider which results in\nhow they think of the service provider as a brand and ultimately creates brand loyalty.\nMeasuring this process with customer experience metrics is important if the service\nprovider wants to boost customer retention. Quality of Experience (QoE) is a measure\nof the overall level of customer satisfaction with a service provider. It is a subjective\nmeasure from the user’s perspective of the overall quality of the service provided. QoE\nhas historically emerged from Quality of Service (QoS), which attempts to objectively\nmeasure service parameters (such as packet loss rates or average throughput).\nTherefore, operations should be equipped with the ability to be aware of how the\ncustomers perceive the services through transaction net promoter score survey and\nautomatically detect service anomaly. The failure to be aware, analyze, decide and\nexecute service recovery on time before customer experiences the service disruption is\nsubject to impact on customer lifetime value or even churn. As a result, the revenue,\nprofitability and even brand name are affected. In order to build capabilities that are\nrelated to customer experience, we need the ability to assess the maturity level and\nbuild the capability within the digital operation model in aligning to the strategic\nframework.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 10 of 61\nGB1042B Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0\n3. New approaches and capabilities to drive\nthe digital operation model\nThere is an increasing interest across the ICT industry to further develop the digital\noperation model and drive implementations aimed to provide verticals, enterprise and\nconsumers with autonomous operations and more innovative services featuring zero-\nwait, zero-contact, zero-fault and full autonomy capabilities. At the same time, many\nchallenges need to be solved in terms of how to objectively approach the AOMM for\nANL process automation, build, operate and run those networks that are characterized\nas self-served, self-healing and above all, self-optimized deployments \\[1\\]. The simple\nanswer is to follow its target architecture and satisfy the industry accepted\nimplementation path for full digitalization and intelligentization of network operation and\nmaintenance. In reality, more constructive and concrete help is needed from many\naspects in practice.\nHere, we are trying to provide some clear steps and more constructive directions that\nwould be of use and instrumental in Autonomous Operations practices, when deploying\nand operating the \"3 Layers and 4-Closed Loops\" TM Forum AN Framework \\[2\\]. The\nAN Level Framework illustrates the combination of both human operators (P) and\nautonomous systems (S) involved in achieving certain level of autonomy and proposes\nthe following Lifecycle Management categories of capabilities shown below:\n• Execution – the execution of a decided solution which could be adjusting and\nconfiguring the network parameters.\n• Awareness – the tasks of collecting data from external environment which\ninclude network performance data, network configuration data, quality or status\nof the service, and customer related information such as SLA.\n• Analysis – the group of tasks that analyze data generated in the awareness\nstage and use available technology to predict a change or future status or make\nan applicable recommendation for decision.\n• Decision – the tasks of evaluating the recommended network adjustment\nsolutions, operation scope or customer experience related solution options for\nrequired management and operation decision to be executed.\n• Intent/Experience – the tasks of generating and determining network\noptimization related, service operation related, or customer experience related\ncontrol information.\n3.1. Service Capability Maturity Assessment through\nAOMM Operation Flows\nThe AOMM provides organization with a best practice methodology and tool to assess\nas-is business capability and set target across the business operation, service and\nresource operations flow that includes Planning, Deployment, Maintenance,\nOptimization and Operations. For each of the operation flow, it is decomposed into\nsub-flow with service capabilities that can be referenced to the eTOM business\nprocess. For ease of reference to the eTOM business process, each of the operation\nsub-flows is mapped with the eTOM process. In order to build service capability in the\nareas of customer experience management, a few customer experiences related sub-\nflows are added to the Planning and Operations AOMM operation flow introduced in\nIG1269.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Page 12 of 61\nGB1042A Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0\nThe Autonomous Operations (AO) capabilities for any relevant scope of activities and\ntasks needed to be defined within the operation flow context are realized by designing\nservice intents and associated control loops to describe necessary steps needed to\nfulfill defined business goals and certain management purposes.\nThis intent-driven approach starts from describing \"what\" are desired outcomes from an\nAutonomous Domain, rather than exposing details of \"how\" to configure resources\nwithin any Autonomous Domain and presents essential prerequisites for enabling Self-\nX capabilities. Closed-loops are on the other side an essential part of an Autonomous\nDomain optimization of relevant services and their operational behaviors, like resource\nusage optimization, cost-effectiveness goals and perfecting trade-offs between tenant\nservice types and resource instances required to be involved.\nAutonomous Domains may be composed of one more closed-loop and if required\nthose closed control loops could be bound together to realize the intent-driven services\nfor supporting resources according to the defined supervision and control objectives.\nAlso, one control loop can be used across multiple Autonomous Domains, so a bigger\nAutonomous Domain can be constructed by its design to serve necessary business\ngoals.\nThe key focus of building Autonomous Operations deployments is on developing\nstronger and more effective Customer Experience Management and Customer Support\ncapabilities, based on agility through specific intents and the consistency imposed by\nrelevant closed-loop control mechanisms.\n3.2. Capability Build-up Domains\n3.2.1. Customer Experience Management\nAs part of the Planning stage, the first proposed Capacity Management capability is\naimed, through its intent at proactively strengthening Customer Experience\nManagement (CEM) where possible and delivered through carefully defined tasks\nwithin each closed-loop. Proactive User Experience Management is designed through\na Machine learning model for eliciting customer insights and predictive user experience\nplanning based on measuring service usage characteristics (service uptake, app trend,\nservice KQIs) and customer behavior patterns (HVC trends, customer complaints,\nFCR) to improve customer satisfaction.\nThe five Lifecycle Management categories of tasks for the Proactive User Experience\nPlanning capability are shown in the following figure.\n3.2.2.

At the same time, the system is\naware of the resource inventory management status to achieve a balance between\nQoE and resource dynamically reallocation.\nThen, Analysis category is about the group of tasks with a goal to analyze individual\nservice consumption and resource demand through metrics like ARPU, Data of Usage\n(DoU), type of package, KPIs, as well as internal service demands measured via Key\nQuality Indicators, service update, number of device replacements and supply factors\nmetrics like network capacity utilization rate, traffic congestion rate, and the\ngeographical coverage.\nFollowing the Analysis stage and based on all results generated, a Decision group of\ntasks makes relevant decisions about the analyzed service uptake, user migration or\nother type of user acquisitions and customer segment growth and in general performs\ndecision-making how to achieve the Customer Satisfaction goals and at the same time\nbalance the network supply.\nBased on all decisions made, the Execution group of tasks actually deliver this\npredictive user experience planning operation flow as part of Capacity Management.\nThe execution also includes the activation of the policy, control function and service\nprovisioning, proposed user migration and device replacement activities, proactive\nproblem-solving, as well as delivering marketing campaigns and relevant offers and\npromotions, all with an ultimate goal of proactively and continuously improving\ncustomer experience and Net Promoter Score (NPS).\n3.2.3. Customer Support\nCatalyst Scenario for Customer Support Interface Management\nWithin the Operation stage, Customer Support capabilities defined here with an intent\nto be able to interact with customer more effectively. Therefore, they are aimed at fully\nautomating customer profile and interface management where feasible to implement\nthose operation flows and needed to explore, record and manage customer profile and\ncontact details, customer inventory and service requirements within its given closed-\nloop, to achieve a more effective customer relationship during the whole Customer\nLifecycle Management (CLM).\nThe Customer Support Interface Management closed-loop with its Lifecycle\nManagement categories of tasks are depicted in the figure below.\n© TM Forum 2023.

The closed-loop defined here has a goal of defining QoS metrics for analyzing\nkey customer facing indicators and then, determining capability gaps. This autonomous\ncapability, through its Lifecycle Management categories of tasks should be\ncontinuously adapting the E2E Operation maturity evaluation.\nFigure 3-4 Customer Support - Improve QoS in Meeting SLAs closed-loop\n© TM Forum 2023.

The decision-making should be driven with an ultimate goal of\nimproving customer experience and meeting all defined Service Level Agreement\ntargets and contractual commitments.\nBased on the decisions from the previous stage, the Execution group of tasks for this\noperation flow delivers actions and improvement tasks from the list of available\nactivities in line with the criteria and targets setup in the contract or re-defined in line\nwith the business goals.\nCatalyst Scenario of Customer Retention and Loyalty\nThe Customer Support capability for improving Customer Retention and Loyalty\ndefines an intent of improving customer experience based on AI/ML support for\nmanaging customer Interaction and deriving real-time customer insights for automating\nCustomer Lifetime Value (CLV) calculation. As such, it should include a self-learning\nmodel built with efficient customer behavior and pattern recognition and self-learning\ncapability for identifying customer service usage trends, high value customer usage\nidentification, registering events, campaigns and promotions taken, and where\npossible, optionally tracking typical and peculiar service preferences with perceived\nexperience levels.\nThe closed-loop for improving Customer Retention and Loyalty with its Lifecycle\nManagement task categories is shown in the figure below.\nFigure 3-5 Customer Operation – Customer Retention and Loyalty closed-loop\nThe Aware category of this operation flow for improving Customer Retention and\nLoyalty in line with Omnichannel strategy looks at all customer touch-points available\nand monitors all user interactions, like customer/high-value customer usage events,\ncustomer complaints, service and promotion uptakes and marketing conversion\nsuccess rate, renewals, in order to get a full picture of all customers.\n© TM Forum 2023.

All decisions should have a direct\ncorrelation with Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) and Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)\nindicators to prove their validity in strengthening customer retention and loyalty.\nBased on all decisions made available, the Execution group of tasks should, in line with\nthe priority list, execute proposed actions and service improvement activities, that\nwould ultimately boost customer retention and customer loyalty with actual\nmonetization and potential revenue improvement metrics.\n3.3. Capability Assessment for Service\nThe maturity level assessment of AOMM is carried out based on three steps:\n1. Defining the autonomous operation behavior of a specific network operations\nclosed loop automation lifecycle that is made up of intent, awareness, analysis,\ndecision, and execution stages of a control loop.mechanism.\n2. Assessing degree of Autonomy for each of the stages of a control loop using\ncoverage of the operation flow and the corresponding sub-flows.\n3. Scoring the service capability of each operation sub-flow by weighting the\nresults of the Step 2 assessment to create and overall Autonomous Level\nvalue.\nThe assessment of each sub-flow will be on the capability of each closed loop stage;\nintent, awareness, analysis, decision, and execution to complete its operation process.\nThe following table provides a list of the operation flow, capabilities that are referenced\nto the leTOM business process, and questionnaires.\n© TM Forum 2023.

However, the question is that does each of the 5 stages carry the\nsame weightage. Prior to the framework maturing with a dimension weightage distribution methodology, the AOMM tool takes the assumption\nof an equal weighting distribution as shown in table 2.\nThe list of questionnaire samples is constructed in a way to assist quick assessment of CSP's maturity in the ANL. The sequence of each\nresponse is mapped to the corresponding ANL. For example, the selection \"1\" of a question is mapped to Level 1 of the ANL. The selection \"2\"\nof a question is mapped to Level 2 of the ANL and so forth.\nAfter which, each sub-flow will be scored based on the merit of each of autonomous networks closed loop stage. The Level 2 capability scoring\nis computed based on weighted average of the individual sub-flow. The Level 1 capability will take the aggregate of each domain of the\noperation flow.

Leveraging AOMM to align operations to\nbusiness strategy\nThe success of executing an organization strategy is dependent on how well the\norganization executes its operating model to achieve its business strategy. The\noperating model defines the model which includes the required business capabilities\nunderpinning the people, process, resources and information necessary to implement\nthe strategy. For instance, if an organization seeks the digital operating model to\nexecute its digital transformation strategy, the question is whether there is a strong\nalignment between the organization capabilities, operating model and the business\nstrategy. The AOMM will serve the purpose in the capability gaps identification and the\ncapability blueprint formulation to prepare the operation in executing the strategy.\n4.1. Objective AOMM Assessment\nThe AOMM is introduced to provide an assessment of the organization as-is capability\nmaturity level, set the next level target, and identify the business capability gaps. The\nmaturity assessment is scored from both the inside-out and the outside-in view which\ncould be from various functional teams and external consulting company. The objective\nfor engaging multiple parties in the assessment is to assist in eliminating biasness or\nany possible hidden agenda.\nMaturity models are a common part of the transformation toolkit and are heavily used\nin project & process management, however research shows that they rarely result in\nperformance improvements (Jugdev, 2002). Maturity models are characterized by\ncheck lists against paper process which probably has undergone several rounds of\nchanges in the field without diligently updated or process models that oversimplify\nreality and lack quantifiable evidence (McCormack, 2009). This lack of empirical\nfoundation results in recommendations and priorities that lack the economical\nfoundation and the level of business justification required in telecom operators and\nenterprises who are looking for return of investment in months and not years.\nThe company has agreed that they need to transform a part of the business and a\ntransformation lead and team is established. This team will usually start by carrying out\nface-to-face interviews with top managers and operational managers to get some\nguidance.\nThen key individuals in the organization will be identified for data gathering through\nworkshops, questionnaires, calls etc. In parallel with this activity the key performance\nindicators (KPIs) of the programme will be identified and systems teams will be\nengaged to start producing glide paths and other relevant information. Data driven\noperations with process transparency will provide obvious and clear areas of\nenhancement and process optimization opportunity.\nFurthermore, consultants may be brought into benchmark, assess and advise on the\ncurrent way of working and opportunities for change which typically introduces an\nindustry maturity model. But all too often the consultant is applying lessons learned\nfrom a commercial environment (geography, regulatory, contractual etc.) that is often\nfar different from the current operator.\nTM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. . Page 45 of 61\nGB1042A Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0\nTherefore, when it comes to the AOMM assessment, it is imperative to have a\ntransparent data driven process mining model in providing guidance to an objective\nand consistent approach in determining the AO maturity level and identifying areas of\ncapability requirement to drive operation efficiency towards autonomy.\n4.2. Process Mining Model\nThere are four key stages behind the process mining model which will enable\ncompanies to use the model efficiently and technology providers to develop it further\nfor specific industries. At the same time, the industry standard will provide the basis for\nfurther innovations, such as for expanding the scope of the system to include artificial\nintelligence, machine learning and then industrializing it. The process mining model\nwhen established as an industry standard will be instrumental in companies' successful\ndigital transformation.\nFigure 4-1 Process Mining Model\nThe process mining model defines the 4-stage process mining methodology, tools and\nprocess governance for standardized best practices, and rules and policy for closed\nloop automation enablement. The 4-stage process mining are as follows:\n4.2.1. Process Discovery\nThis technology extracts data from event logs in transactional systems that support key\nprocesses and makes it possible to understand and measure actual process flows and\nvariations. In other words, it allows for process analysis without much human\nintervention.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 46 of 61\nGB1042A Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0\nFigure 4-2 Event Log Sample\nInput for process mining is an event log. A traditional event log views a process from a\nparticular angle provided by the case notion that is used to correlate events. Each\nevent in such an event log refers to (1) a particular process instance (called a case),\n(2) an activity, and (3) a timestamp. There may be additional event attributes referring\nto resources, people, costs, etc., but these are optional. With some effort, such data\ncan be extracted from any information system supporting operational processes.\n(processmining.org, n.d.)\n4.2.2. Process Analysis\nProcess mining methodically discover event data and process models from the event\nlogs, covert the CSV file to XES format where the process map is replayed and\nrevealed the actual operation process flow. eXtensible Event Stream (XES) is the\nstandard format for process mining adopted by the IEEE Task Force for logging\nevents.\nDuring the process analysis stage, the application highlights the process non-\nconformance from the target operating model, areas of process friction, identify\nimprovement opportunities and recommends process enhancement.\nAn understanding and measuring a process and the resources it consumes is\nimportant and valuable because it provides insights on the end-to-end process with the\nalarm size and transit duration from one state to another.\n4.2.3. Process Enhancement\nAfter much analysis is done on the event data behavior and process model, areas of\noptimization or improvement on the existing process model using information about the\nactual process recorded in the event log. One type of enhancement is service quality\nrecovery, modifying the model to better reflect reality. For example, if two activities are\nmodeled sequentially but in reality, can happen in any order, then the model may be\ncorrected to reflect this. Extension could be another perspective of the process\nenhancement, for example, by using timestamps in the event log of the customer\ncomplaint handling process, the existing process model could be extended to show\nbottlenecks, service levels, and frequencies. To drive process automation, process\nmodels that involved long and much manual effort could be identified for process\noptimization, for example, introducing rules, policy and API for a closed loop\nautomation.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 47 of 61\nGB1042A Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0\n4.2.4. Process Prediction\nThe process discovery can be extended with information to predict the completion time\nof running instances.\nBy replaying event logs one can build predictive models, i.e., for the different states of\nthe model particular predictions can be made. For example, a predictive model learned\nby replaying many cases could show that the expected time until completion after\nenabling is \"X\" hours.\nIn the data-based industrial process prediction practice, there are multiple classification\nstrategies for the data-based industrial process prediction techniques, in which three\naspects are the most commonly considered, e.g., data feature-based methods,\ntimescale based, and the prediction reliability-based. For each of the characteristics of\npredicting modeling, there are commonly used prediction techniques which include the\ntime series-based methods, the factor-based methods, the prediction intervals\nconstruction methods, and the granular-based long term prediction methods.\nIn network operations, there are many scenarios where reliable time prediction is\nbeneficial to service providers especially when it comes to enhancing the customer\nexperience through effective customer complaint handling. For example, when a\ncustomer calls in the contact center to make a complaint on VoLTE service quality, the\nCustomer Complaint handling agent would be able to response to the customer with an\nexpected service quality recovery time through the reliable time prediction modeling\n4.3. Process Mining Model for AN Levels\nProcess mining model that connects the data science and process science in providing\nprocess transparency to the Autonomous Operation framework. The process mining\nmodel optimizes business outcomes and drives business value in accelerating the zero\ntouch operation journey.\nAO Maturity Model assessment provides a means to establish the as-is capability\nmaturity level which is classified into 6 levels. Apart from a few distinct characteristics\nthat describes each autonomous network level (ANL), the 6-level ANL varies between\nlevel of maturity by the degree of man-machine collaboration. The question is that is\nthere an objective approach to determine the degree of man-machine collaboration and\nconsequently classifying the ANL the operation is at.\nThe process mining discovers an end-to-end process model from the event logs.\nFor the man-machine collaboration analysis, this guide will only be focusing on the\ncommon trace of the process flow and leaving the exceptional trace for non-\nconformance analysis. Common trace of the process model can be easily identified\nthrough the event data size and behavior. For the mapping of the process model to the\nANL analysis, only the common trace will be considered.\nThe end-to-end process lifecycle can be divided into 5 stages; namely intent, aware,\nanalysis, decision, and execution. Based on the time stamp of the event data transits\nfrom one activity to the next, one can quickly deduce if the operation is manual effort,\nautomated or people assisted by system.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved Page 48 of 61\nGB1042A Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0\nFigure 4-3 Mapping of Process Mining Replay to ANL\nTake for example the trouble-to-resolution process model replayed on the process\nmining map, we can gather from the diagram that the activity from alarm generate to\ntrouble ticket create took only 5 mins 25s. The task between those two activities will\ninclude alarm compression, alarm correlation and trouble ticket create. Given the\namount of effort in processing the fault management, it is undoubtedly to conclude that\nthe fault management process is automated. This means that the operation would have\nbeen equipped with a system to be aware of the network equipment details which\ninclude the alarm type and classification collected from the EMS. The analysis of the\nalarm compression, cross domain correlation and root caused analysis has been\nautomated through predefined rules and policy. At the Decision stage on problem\nmanagement and Execution stage on problem resolution, the duration from one activity\nto the next took about one hour plus respectively. One can conclude that the two\nstages are primarily manual driven. There is room for process optimization through\nautomation at those two stages.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Assessing and Measuring Values of\nAutonomous Operations\nFigure 5-1 Capabilities and attributes of Autonomy\nTo assess and measure the values of autonomous operations, it is important to\nunderstand the capabilities and the respective attributes that autonomous operations\nshould be equipped with. Autonomous Operations involve the ability to automate, to\nadapt to dynamic environments, and to self-governing without much human\nintervention. Autonomous operation is about building capabilities on automation that\nlearns and adapts to dynamic environments and evolves as the environment around it\nchanges. The autonomous system will learn from an increasing data set faster, and\neventually more reliably in decision-making under an evolving and non-deterministic\nenvironment, than what would be reasonable for a human.\nAutonomous Operations in the automation spectrum requires a complex mix of\nadvanced technologies such as AI and ML in combination with organization design and\nprocess changes. There is no doubt that autonomous operations will bring great value\nto an organization that is worth the investment. Investment in technology to build\ncapabilities in realizing business benefits needs to be justified. The values of building\nthe autonomous operation capabilities could be assessed through well-defined use\ncases and measured by a set of operational metrics. To illustrate the applications of\n© TM Forum 2023.

Use Cases in the Catalyst\nUse Case Background\nOperator XYZ is the market leader in the country, serving over 50 million subscribers.\nThe company provides voice, data, video and digital services to consumers, enterprise\nand home customers. Operator XYZ has embarked on digital operation transformation\nas part of their strategy to achieve their business objectives; to lead NPS and reduce\nannual operating expenses by 20%.\nIn preparation for the 5G launch, Operator XYZ is retiring the 3G networks to free up\nspectrum for 5G networks. VoLTE service subscription is expected to grow in 10 folds.\nVoLTE service quality will have a direct impact on customer experience.\nOperator XYZ is embarking on zero touch operation journey through leveraging\ntechnology and building intelligent operation capabilities to drive autonomy.\nA step-by-step guide to the identification and capability development through the use of\nAOMM assessment, process mining model and Value Operation Framework (VOF)\ncan be applied:\nStage 1: Assessment and Planning\nStep 1: Assessment of as-is maturity level through Process Mining and Discovery\nWorkshop\nThe as-is maturity level will be carried out with a combination of process mining and\ndiscovery workshop.

In addition, examples of the lifecycle of Services\nare illustrated for understanding the usage of business requirements and framework.\nThis document serves as the general guideline for pertinent work streams and work\nitems, including user stories and use cases, technical architecture and interface/APIs\nspecs, PoCs/catalyst projects, testing and verification, as well as industry collaboration.\nMoreover, it will be used as the baseline for the marketing plan, campaign, social\nevents and public whitepaper on behalf of the TM Forum and member companies.\nIn order to guide the development of Autonomous Networks, a top-to-down, user-\ncentric and business driven approach is used to derive the general business\nrequirements and define overall business framework for formulating some common\nservices and capabilities of Autonomous Networks. The common Autonomous\nNetworks Services are categorized into five types as the matrix of business growth &\noperational efficiency, as well as automation & autonomy:\n• Business growth:\n1. Network services automation e.g., VPN, SD-WAN, 5G connectivity\n2. Autonomous ICT services e.g., network + cloud + edge\n3. Autonomous digital enabling services e.g., ICT services + platforms\n(operations, collaboration)\n• Operational efficiency:\n4. Network operations automation e.g., predefined services and operations\n5. Autonomous Networks operations e.g., platform based, dynamic process,\nflexible production operations\nThe key requirements of business framework of Autonomous Networks are as follows:\n• The basic business metrics of Autonomous Networks is called “Zero-X”\nexperience, which specify the overall characteristics of Autonomous Networks\nservices including zero-wait, zero-touch, zero-trouble and zero-friction. The\nmeasure of autonomous level of AN service is based on the autonomy\n(automation + intelligence) of E2E lifecycle of the services from customer\nperspective, rather than the technology and/or element implementation.\n• The fundamental ingredients of Autonomous Networks are simplified\ninfrastructure, closed loops, autonomous domain, intent driven interaction. The\nsimplified infrastructure is the fundament of Autonomous Networks, which\nimplies fewer layers, fewer hops in the context of network architecture, less\ncomplicated protocols, more automated network management & operations.\nThe closed loop is the core operation of Autonomous Networks, which\nrepresents the full lifecycle of related business, including\nuser/business/service/resource closed loops. The user closed loops is the main\nthread to streamline and drive the E2E lifecycle of services. Autonomous\nDomains are the basic logical business entities to expose network\nresources/functionalities as services/capabilities in support E2E lifecycle of\nautomated intelligent network/ICT services.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 8 of 41\nIG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0\nIntent based interaction is the main mechanism in support of closed loops across\ndifferent layers.\n• Self-operation (Self-X) capabilities are the main functions to support above\nbusiness requirements, which include self-serving (self-planning/design, self-\nordering, self-marketing), self-fulfilling (self-organizing, self-managing, self-\ngoverning), and self-assuring (self-monitoring/reporting, self-healing, self-\noptimizing), and so on.\nThis release of the document enhances IG1218 V1.0 that mainly serves as the overall\nskeleton and high level business requirements and framework. The rapid iterative\napproach is used to further the details in the future releases.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 9 of 41\nIG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0\nIntroduction\nThe ultimate goal of Autonomous Networks is to enable the digital transformation and\nseamless service experience of vertical industries and consumers through\nAutonomous Networks/ICT services, meanwhile improve the operational efficiency of\nthe telecom/ICT industry through automated, intelligent close loops of operations.\nObviously, it requires the ecosystem & collaboration across the industries, among the\nservice providers, suppliers, and integrators, as well as the customers. The main\ndrivers of the ecosystem and collaboration are the business value and customer\nexperience enabled by the autonomy of Autonomous Networks, which can offer a\nsimplified, easy-to-use and dynamic network/ICT services and capabilities. Therefore,\na user-centric, business driven, top-to-down approach is essential to the success of\nAutonomous Networks.\nThe Autonomous Networks should focus on the innovative, common and open\nmethods to minimize the complexity, cost and fragmentation, and maximize the\nflexibility, efficiency and experience of telecom/ICT services and infrastructure. It is of\nnecessity to depict the requirements and characteristics of common services of\nAutonomous Networks, and autonomous levels of AN services; the architectural\nfunctionalities and capabilities support the above services, which they serve as the\ncommon business languages for all partners to communicate and collaborate.\nThe term Autonomous Networks describes the telecom system (including management\nsystem and network) capabilities that can be self-operating with minimal to no human\nintervention. Autonomous Networks essentially is an integrated set of programmable\nsystems, bring high-value and personalizing experience for customers, support CSP to\nimprove efficiency, enable innovation, and increase revenue, with overall network\nagility, security and resiliency. It is essential to derive a set of general business\nrequirements and offer common business framework and capabilities for various user\nscenarios, and more importantly a set of key metrics to measure the autonomous\nlevels of those business capabilities following the same criteria of overall autonomous\nlevels defined in vision document.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Methodology\nThis clause describes the overall development method of Autonomous Networks.\nMethodology of Business requirements & capabilities development\nThe basic method is to use a user-centric, top-to-down, business driven and rapid\niterative approach to develop all contents of Autonomous Networks:\n• User-centric: follow the end users (vertical industries, CSPs’ business owners\nand consumers) business logic to collect user stories (e.g., smart city, smart\nmanufacture, self-driving car)\n• Top-down: Each Autonomous Networks (AN) Service shall represent the full\nlifecycle of the network/ICT service required by the certain type of users\n(multiple user stories) ,based on the Autonomous Networks framework, which\nthe full lifecycle process can be expanded and analyzed from top to down.\nBusiness driven identify business requirements and capabilities to distill\nbusiness metrics and define business framework.\n• Rapid Iterative approach: illustrate the user scenarios, reference solutions and\ncatalyst project for Autonomous Networks per select AN case and refine\nbusiness requirements and frameworks.\n* AN Cases describes components of lifecycle of AN services\nFigure 1. Methodology of Business requirements & capabilities development\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 12 of 41\nIG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0\nThe step-by-step process to develop business requirements and framework of\nAutonomous Networks is as follows:\n1) Start with user stories: collect and describe how AN is used from the end user\nperspective\n2) Generalize as AN services: define and describe full lifecycle of common AN\nservices\n3) Compose of multiple AN case: demarcate and describe key steps/capabilities of\nfull lifecycle of common AN service as AN case, which maps the AN service to the\noperation process and Autonomous Networks framework.\n4) Distill common requirements and framework: summarize and normalize the\ncommon business metrics and capabilities in conjunction with autonomous levels,\nwhich is also used to as the inputs for technical architecture and implementations.\nDistill key business requirements, metrics and capabilities\nIt is crucial to distill common business requirements, metrics and capabilities for AN\nservice based on various user story scenarios. The following table illustrates the basic\napproach and relationship between user stories, AN services and common business\nrequirements, metrics and capabilities. Further details are described in clause 2.\nTable 1. Distill key business requirements, metrics and capabilities from user\nstories/autonomous services/cases\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

Business vision\nAccording to the Autonomous Networks Whitepaper [1,2,3] the business vision of\nAutonomous Networks is to provide innovative ICT services and capabilities with “Zero\nX” (zero wait, zero touch, zero trouble) experience for the users of vertical industries\nand consumers, which makes them simpler to consume by the users, and leaves the\nimplementation complexity with the providers.\nFigure 2. Opportunities to ICT Industry\nObviously, Autonomous Networks are able to provide two types of innovative services:\n• As a Service: One stop, real-time, on demand, automated, E2E full lifecycle\nnetwork/ICT services\n• As a platform: Enablement of business collaboration & ecosystem between\nverticals and network/ICT service providers\nThey can also enable highly automated business and network operations of “zero x”\nexperience for innovative services as well as existing services.\nTherefore, Autonomous Networks should focus on the following objectives for the “Zero\nx” experience Network/ICT services through transformation and innovation of\nproduction & commercialization and architecture & operations of the telecom/ICT\nindustry:\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 14 of 41\nIG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0\nFigure 3. Objectives of Autonomous Networks\nAs described in the vision document [4], Autonomous Networks aim to provide fully\nautomated zero wait, zero touch, zero trouble innovative network/ICT services for\nvertical industries users and consumers, and support self-configuration, self-healing,\nself-optimizing and self-evolving telecom network infrastructures for telecom internal\nusers: planner, service/marketing, operations and management, which:\n• Consist of simplified network architecture, virtualized components, automating\nagents, intelligent decision engines and self-dynamic capabilities to create\nintelligent business/network operations for the closed loop of new digital\nbusiness, which,\n• Offer disruptive services for innovative user experience, critical services based\non fully automated lifecycle operations and self-organizing, dynamic optimized\nresource.\n• Aim to provide fully automated zero wait, zero touch, zero trouble innovative,\ncritical network/ICT services for vertical industries users and consumers, and\n• Support self-operating (self-serving, self-fulfilling, and self-assuring)\nnetwork/ICT infrastructures and services for enabling digital transformation of\nvertical and telecom industries through full lifecycle of operations.\n2.2. Business models Support\nThe ultimate goal of Autonomous Networks is to upgrade the telecom market structure\nwith simplified, automated and intelligent ICT/network services that will enable the\ndigitalization of various industries and consumers. In order to achieve this objective, it\nis essential to transform the existing business models to some new production,\nbusiness and collaboration models:\n• Digital partner collaboration and ecosystem model: all partners will\ncollaborate to form partner ecosystem for offering on demand, personalized and\nreal time services and capabilities to the customers, which is different from\ntraditional customer-provider-supplier model, AKA everything as a service.\n• Collaborative production model: in order to achieve a new partner\necosystem, a collaborative production model is pivotal to leverage the best-suit\nsolutions using best breed technologies through win-win benefit sharing\ncollaboration.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 15 of 41\nIG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0\n• Knowledge-as-a-service operations model: in order to enable collaborative\nproduction, the operations knowledge should be shared and monetized through\na common platform as an enabling service.\nFigure 4. New models enabled by Autonomous Networks\nAutonomous Networks enables above business models through self-x operating (self-\nserving, self-fulfilling, and self-assuring) capabilities, which streamline the business\ncollaboration of ecosystem partners by the common autonomous levels.\nRoles and Responsibilities of Autonomous Networks:\nIn the context of Autonomous Networks, responsibilities regarding AN must be clearly\ndefined and assigned to roles. The roles related to AN include:\n• Communication / business Service Customer (CSC): Uses communication\nservices.\n• Communication/business Service Provider (CSP): Provides communication\nservices. Designs, builds, and operates its communication services. The CSP\nprovided communication service can be built with or without network .\n• Network Operator (NOP): Provides network services including CFS services\nand RFS services. Designs, builds, and operates its networks to offer such\nservices.\n• Domain Network Solution Provider (NSP): Supplies resource closed-loop\nsolution to NOP and CSP.\n• OSS or BSS solution provider: Provide services closed-loop operation solution\nor business closed-loop operation solution to CSP and NOP.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Roles and Responsibilities of Autonomous\nNetworks\nIn the context of Autonomous Networks, responsibilities regarding operations have to\nbe clearly defined and assigned to roles. Similar as defined by [5], the roles related to\nAN include:\n• AN Service Customer (ANSC): Uses AN services\n• AN Service Provider (ANSP): Provides AN service at various levels of\noperations per AN framework, i.e., at business, service and resource levels, to\ndesign, build and operate its AN service. The ANSP provided AN service can\nbe built with or without underlying infrastructure.\n• AN Solution Provider (ANSOP): Supplies AN solution. It could be at\nautonomous domain level with or without underlying infrastructure. The\nunderlying infrastructure could be virtualized or physical elements.\nDepending on actual scenarios:\n• Each role can be played by one or more organizations simultaneously.\n• An organization can play one or several roles simultaneously.\nFigure 5. High-level model of AN roles\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 21 of 41\nIG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0\n4. Autonomous Networks Framework and\nCapabilities\n4.1. Autonomous Networks Framework\nThe framework of Autonomous Networks identifies 3-layers + 4-closed loops:\n3-layers: are common capabilities of operations that can be utilized to support all\nscenarios and business needs:\n• Resource operations layer: mainly provide network resources and capabilities\nautomation in each autonomous domain level.\n• Service operations layer: mainly provide the capabilities for network planning,\ndesign, rollout, provisioning, assurance and optimization operations across\nmultiple autonomous domains.\n• Business operations layer: mainly provide the capabilities for customer,\necosystem and partner business enabling and operations for Autonomous\nNetworks services\n4-closed loops: to fulfill the full lifecycle of the interlayer interaction\n1) User closed loop: the interaction across three layers and three closed loops to\nsupport the user service fulfillment.\n2) Business closed loop: the interaction between business and service\noperations, which may trigger related service and resource closed loops in its\nfulfillment.\n3) Service closed loop: the interaction between service and network resource\noperations，\n4) Which may trigger related resource closed loops in its fulfillment.\n5) Resource closed loop: the interaction of network resource operations in the\ngranularity of autonomous domains.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 22 of 41\nIG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0\nFigure 6. Autonomous Networks Framework\nAutonomous Network Framework as shown above illustrates the rationale of\ncorrelation and interaction among the closed loops of different layers:\n• User closed loop is the main thread to streamline the business/service/resource\nclosed loops.\n• Each business/service/resource closed loop is to address the interaction\nbetween adjacent layers.\n• The interaction between adjacent layers is to be simple, business driven and\ntechnology/implementation independent, i.e., communicating and fulfilling the\nintents (business/service/resource) rather than technology-prone commands\nbased the intent mechanisms and interfaces.\n• The different intents are used for the interactions of different layers, i.e.,\nbusiness intent, service intent and resource intent.\n4.2. Autonomous Networks Levels\nAs described in clause 1, through analyzing a collection of user stories, common\nServices are defined as the template of the service offering, which is further developed\nwith AN business requirement and capabilities. The autonomous levels are used as the\ncommon model and metrics to measure and fulfill the AN service, and corresponding\nbusiness requirements (customer experience, SLA) and key capabilities across the\nindustry ecosystem and partners (e.g., customer, CSP, solution provider and integrator\netc.).\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 23 of 41\nIG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0\nFigure 7. Autonomous levels for AN services and capabilities\nIn order to measure and fulfill customer experience and SLA, the corresponding\nautonomous levels will be defined, which are used to guide the improvement of\nnetwork automation & intelligence, evaluate the value and benefits of AN services\ncapability, and guide the intelligent upgrade of CSP and vendors.\nThe driving force for defining the autonomous levels:\n• Align the AN concept: telecom industry conforms a unified understanding of AN,\nand promotes a consistent understanding of the value of different levels of AN.\n• Align the roadmap of AN capability: telecom industry reaches a consensus on\nthe development of AN capabilities, driving the industry ecosystem to develop\naccording to the roadmap.\nThe categorization of AN Levels is illustrated in Table 7. The basic criterion is that the\nautonomous levels of AN services are based on the closed loops of business lifecycle\nand value, for instance, if the closed loop is only fulfilled at the element level, it is at\nmost in Level 1; if the closed loop is fulfilled at the E2E full lifecycle of select AN\nservice, it is in Level 4.\nTable 7. Levels of Autonomous Networks\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 24 of 41\nIG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0\n− Level 0 - manual management: The system delivers assisted monitoring\ncapabilities, which means all dynamic tasks have to be executed manually.\n− Level 1 - assisted management: The system executes a certain repetitive\nsub-task based on pre-configured to increase execution efficiency.\n− Level 2 - partial Autonomous Networks: The system enables partial\nautomatic O&M for certain units based on predefined rule/policy under certain\nexternal environments.\n− Level 3 - conditional Autonomous Networks: Building on L2 capabilities, the\nsystem with awareness can sense real-time environmental changes, and in\ncertain network domains, optimize and adjust itself to the external environment.\n− Level 4 - high Autonomous Networks: Building on L3 capabilities, the system\nenables, in a more complicated cross-domain environment, analyze and make\ndecision based on predictive or active closed-loop management of service and\ncustomer experience-driven networks.\n− Level 5 - full Autonomous Networks: This level is the goal for telecom\nnetwork evolution. The system possesses closed-loop automation capabilities\nacross multiple services, multiple domains, and the entire lifecycle, achieving\nAutonomous Networks.\nThe evaluation process of AN levels requires setting up baselines and identifying\nweaknesses to formulate phase-specific objectives and improvement strategies.\nOperation task baselines are defined based on Table 7 from the perspective of the\nentire O&M process (planning, construction, maintenance, optimization and\noperations). For each operation task, generic technological requirements and level\nevaluation rules are defined from the domain and service perspective, providing a\nreference for defining and instantiating domain-specific ANL.\n4.3. Key requirements of AN capabilities\nAutonomous Networks should support the following capabilities:\nTable 8. Key capabilities:\nSimplified The simplified infrastructure is the fundament of Autonomous\ninfrastructure Networks, which implies fewer layers, fewer hops in the context of\nnetwork architecture, less complicated protocols, more automated\nnetwork management & operations.\nClosed loop The closed loop is the core operations of Autonomous Networks,\nwhich represents the full lifecycle of related business, including\nuser/business/service/resource closed loops.\nAutonomous Autonomous domains are the basic logical business entities to\ndomain expose network resources/functionalities as services/capabilities in\nsupport E2E lifecycle of automated intelligent network/ICT\nservices.\nIntent driven Intent driven interaction is the main mechanism in support of\ninteraction closed loops across different layers.\nSelf-X Self-X operating capabilities are considered in support of single-\noperating layer/domain operations and cross-layer closed loops in the\ncapabilities context of Autonomous Networks.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 25 of 41\nIG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0\nFull-stack AI AI capabilities need to be provided at different layers of\nAutonomous Networks to support AI-based automated closed-loop\nnetwork operations and implement intelligent automation in\ndifferent service scenarios.\n4.3.1. Closed loops\n4-closed loops: to fulfill the full lifecycle of the interlayer interaction\n1) User closed loop: the interaction across the above three layers and three\nclosed loops to support the user service fulfillment. The interactions across the\ndifferent layers should be based on simple, intent based API interfaces.\n2) Business closed loop: the interaction between business and service\noperations.\n3) The operations need to be upgraded from isolated business to on demand,\nautomated business collaboration and ecosystem, which enables the closed\nloop for customer/business/ ecosystem operations, normally requiring\ncollaboration across multiple service providers globally.\n4) Service closed loop: the interaction between service and network resource\noperations.\nThe operations need to be upgraded from legacy customized project-centric\napproach to a data/knowledge driven platform based on full lifecycle operations\nautomation. The most important part is a mindset change from a “build-and-\noperate” to a “design with operate”, and the recognition of the value of\noperations knowledge as a service (KaaS). KaaS is about delivering the right\nknowledge to the right person in the right context at the right time via desktop,\nlaptop or any mobile device. Operations automation sits at the core of\nproduction efficiency and business agility.\n5) Resource closed loop: the interaction of network resource operations in the\ngranularity of autonomous domains.\nThe network needs to be upgraded from fragmented, siloed network element level\nintegration towards a closed loop of network autonomous domain with extremely\nsimplified network architecture, which lay the foundation for the closed loop of network\noperations and collaborative production by means of cross autonomous domain\ncollaboration.\n4.3.2. Autonomous domains\nServices involve multiple layers and closed loops. Autonomous domains serve as the\nbasics unit that can fulfill the closed-loop automation of the lifecycle of specific network\noperations of Autonomous Networks based on the business disposition of network\nfunctions and operations . This reduces technical complexity and conceals the\nvariations of different vendor implementations, thus supporting E2E business\nrequirements of AN services.\nThe boundary of autonomous domains is based upon the network operation\nrequirements and business decision of each CSP. The instantiation of autonomous\ndomain can be defined by CSP based on the factors such as service types, network\ntechnologies, deployment locations, and maintenance organization relationship. The\nexamples of autonomous domain instances can be the closed loops of access, metro\nbackbone, core, edge, customer network from infrastructure perspective, or SD-WAN,\nVoLTE, CDN etc. from service perspective.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 26 of 41\nIG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0\nThe basic principles of the operations of autonomous domains are:\n• Autonomy of individual autonomous domain: each autonomous domain runs in\nself-operating mode per business objective and hides the details of domain\nimplementation, operations and the functions of the domain elements to the\nusers of autonomous domains, with local intelligence and localized knowledge.\n• Collaboration of cross autonomous domain: multiple instances of autonomous\ndomains can be collaborated by upper layers service operations using the\nintent driven interaction to fulfill the lifecycle of network/ICT services.\n• Closed Loop Automation: automation uses closed loop mechanisms to assure\nservice experience by completing workflow steps and continuously adapting to\nensure goals and objectives are met. The control loop adjusts and adapts itself,\nkeeping the system in the desired state.\nFigure 8. Principles of autonomous domains\nThe key characteristics of autonomous domains:\n• Can model the exposure of network and service capabilities as a platform\nand/or services to enable higher-level business services to utilize network\ncapabilities at the domain level instead of element level.\n• Can specify a set of rules at the business level (e.g., Service level availability,\nservice level guarantee based on response times, repair times etc.) that can be\nautomatically monitored and effected across all domains of the architecture in\nsupport of closed loops.\n• Can be instantiated per business dispositions that represent network operations\nof the future e.g., access, edge, core, network services and so on.\n• Each instantiation can be decoupled from another and expose a set of domain-\nbased services via common intent driven interaction/ Open APIs to upper layer\nor other domains.\n• Can be easily nested and integrated by external management systems. For\nexample, data reporting and query capabilities are provided externally.\nProgrammable management service mechanisms allow users to customize\ndata formats, facilitating interconnection with various external management\nsystems and managing various devices.\n4.3.3. Intent driven interaction\nAutonomous Networks need to be able to adapt their operation to the business\nobjectives of the operator as well as expectations of customers and users. The role of\nintent is to communicate all these expectations to the Autonomous Networks. Intent\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 27 of 41\nIG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0\nestablishes machine processable knowledge about goals, targets, requirements and\nconstraints.\nIntent defines what Autonomous Networks are expected to achieve, but it leaves the\ndetails of how a network is designed and operated to the internal operations of the\nnetwork platform. This means that the smart software on the platform can constantly\noptimize how the service is delivered, and we can incrementally add new technologies\nlike Analytics and Machine Learning to constantly improve the implementation.\nIntent is comprehensible: It must be understandable by humans, while being formally\nand unambiguously specified to be processable by machines. It must be\ncomprehensive in what it specifies for matching the semantics within autonomously\noperated domain, and the scope of autonomously operated tasks.\nIntent is declarative: It leaves room for the Autonomous Networks to explore options\nfor finding the optimal solution. Intent declares the wanted results rather than\nprescribing a specific solution. Ideally, intent expresses a utility level goal that\ndescribes the properties of a satisfactory outcome rather than requiring a specific\noutcome.\nIntent is infrastructure agnostic and portable: The expectation expressed by intent\noriginates from contracts and business strategy. It does not change if the underlying\nsystem is replaced or modified. While implementation and capability differences\nbetween system vendors will continue to exist, intent can be ported between system\ngenerations and implementations.\nIntent is complete: Intent defines all goals and expected behavior. If it is not specified\nas intent, it is not a goal the system needs to consider. This also means that concerns\nthat were common sense in human operated systems would need to become explicitly\nexpressed as intent.\nIntent is composable: Multiple intents are given to the Autonomous Networks, and it\nis expected to consider them altogether. Unlike traditional software systems, where\nrequirements are analyzed offline to detect and resolve conflicts prior to\nimplementation, intents are added during run-time. Therefore, an essential capability of\nan autonomous system would be to detect and resolve conflicts.\nIntent is persistent: Intent is valid as long as the goals and requirements it expresses\nare relevant. For example, an intent that specifies a service needs to be delivered\nwould not become invalid once the service is initially provisioned. Intent is rather the\nreason for keeping the service operational and assure its performance. Therefore,\nintent has a life cycle that is actively managed by the user or function that has\ngenerated it.\nIntent is measurable: It uses measurable and ideally standardized metrics to define\nthe target state. This allows automated evaluation of success as well as identification\nof issues and optimization opportunities.\nIntent is layered: It is layered with Business, Service and Resource Intent. Business\nIntent as the top layer. Service in the middle and Resource in the bottom layer.\nLayered intent mechanism drives interaction across these 3-layered intents in\nsupporting closed loops to deliver Self-X experience.\nFor Autonomous Networks, the Intent-interaction model is a must, not optional. The\nrole of Intent is beyond relieving the burden of the user knowing implementation\ndetails. More importantly, it sets the autonomous system's internal goal. And the\nsystem then takes proactive actions to achieve the stated goal based on its\nobservation of the environment. So intent is the fundamental mechanism to utilize the\nservice of the Autonomous Networks.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 28 of 41\nIG1218 Autonomous Networks Business Requirements and Framework v2.2.0\nIntent represents the concerns and objectives of the users of an Autonomous Network.\nIt therefore varies with the diversity of user types and roles:\n• Business intent represents the objectives of a business user. This includes for\nexample the delivery of a custom application defined by SLA. Operators expect\ntheir Autonomous Networks to operate service contracts while meeting revenue\ntargets. Their customers expect a good user experience.\n• Service intent represents the objectives of a service user. A service is\nexpected to deliver functional as well as non-functional attributes. This includes\ntargets, for example on connectivity, bandwidth, latency or availability.\n• Resource intent represents the objectives of resource users. Resources are\nexpected to be allocated so that performance and quality of service targets are\nmet.\nThis indicates that intents target a great variety of concerns across Autonomous\nNetworks Architecture. Therefore, the handling of intent is distributed throughout the\nAutonomous Networks layers and autonomous domains. The interactions between\ndifferent layers are through intent APIs. For example, business intent would be handled\nin business operation and resource intent would be handled within the autonomous\ndomain that matches the concerns addressed by the intent. An intent handling function\nis the basic architectural building block to assemble intent based operation. Figure 11\nshows the intent handling function with its intent API. The diagram also illustrates by\nexample how various instances of intent handlers are allocated across the layers and\nfunctional domains.\nIntent can originate directly from user input through frontend portals. Additional intent\nwould be derived automatically, for example from contracts and service orders. An\nintent handling function would operate its domain by analyzing the discrepancy\nbetween the observed state of the network and the wanted state expressed by intent.\nThe main task of intent handling would be to close this gap as much as possible. It\ndetermines the optimal operational state according to all given intent and then acts to\ntransition the network into this state. This process includes the resolution of inevitable\nconflicts between intent through prioritization and optimization.\nThe intent handling function can act by defining the goals of neighboring or subordinate\ndomains through further intent. Furthermore, for all intent that is given to an intent\nhandler, it is expected to report progress and status back to the source of the intent.\nThis closes a loop. The intent mechanism is therefore instrumental for creating control\nloops throughout the Autonomous Networks Architecture.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

Simplified infrastructure\nThe simplified infrastructure fundamentally guarantees an intelligent and hierarchically\nAutonomous Networks. The simplified network architecture, protocols, devices, sites,\nand deployment solutions offset complexity caused by ultra-high bandwidth and vast\nconnections, improving efficiency and customer experience throughout the network\nlifecycle. For instance, the network is flattened, and the complexity of network\nmaintenance is reduced by simplifying network layers. Simplified network protocols\nfacilitate network configuration and maintenance. Services are decoupled from the\nphysical network, adapting to different service scenarios on one network and allocating\nnetwork resources on demand. The unified cloud platform supports cloud-based\ntransformation of multiple service systems, IT systems, and related scenarios and\nprocesses.\nMeanwhile, more real-time sensing components and AI inference capabilities are\nintroduced to network devices for making them smarter. In this way, the digital sensing\ncapability of resources, services and surrounding environments has been enhanced,\nedge intelligence capabilities such as sensing analysis and decision execution are\nprovided at the data source. For instance, AI models are injected to the networks\nthrough cloud collaboration for online inference, the networks are capable of\nautomated fault analysis, locating, and predictive parameter adjustment, devices can\nbe capable of multidimensional real-time awareness and data reporting, as well as\nworking with the management and control platform to implement real-time network\nvisualization and minute-level fault discovering.\n4.3.5. Self-X Operating capabilities\nIn order to support the full lifecycle of user closed loop, the key capabilities are\ncategorized in a tiered manner. Although those capabilities may be applied to the\noperations within a single layer/domain, they are mainly considered in support of the\ncross-layer closed loops in the context of Autonomous Networks.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Self-Operating (Self-X) capabilities requirements\nCategories Sub-categories\nSelf-serving Self-planning/capability delivery: provides the customization (DIY)\ncapabilities of network/ICT service planning, design and deployment\nSelf-ordering: provides the online, digitalized and/or one-click\nordering capabilities of network/ICT services\nSelf-marketing: provides the automated marketing activities for\ngeneral and/or personalized campaign/promotion\nSelf- Self-organizing: provides the collaboration of\nfulfilling business/service/resource intent delivery\nSelf-orchestration: provides the orchestration and schedule of\nbusiness, services, and resources intent delivery\nSelf-configuration: provides configuration and activation of\nbusinesses, services, and resources intent delivery\nSelf- Self-monitoring/reporting: provide the automatic, continuous\nassuring monitoring and alerting in real time\nSelf-healing: provides the recovery of SLA e.g., performance,\navailability and security in real time\nSelf-optimizing: provides the optimization of SLA e.g., performance,\navailability and security in real time\n4.3.6. Full-Stack AI in Autonomous Networks\nOn Autonomous Networks, AI can be used anywhere as needed. Similar to a human\nbrain in terms of perception, training, inference, decision-making, and execution\nprocesses, AI capabilities need to be provided at different layers of Autonomous\nNetworks. Autonomous Networks are developing towards full-stack AI.\n• Business operations layer: Customer- and business-oriented AI focuses on\nimplementing intelligent applications for various business processes, including\nprecision marketing, customer intent translation, customer experience, and\nflexible combination of products and offerings.\n• Service operations layer: AI oriented to service intents and cross-domain\ncollaboration focuses on implementing intelligent applications for various\nservice processes, including service intent translation, E2E resource\norchestration and scheduling, SLA policy production, and E2E fault and\nperformance management.\n• Resource operations layer: AI in an autonomous domain is responsible for\nlocal lightweight development, model retraining, and AI asset management,\nefficiently implementing generalization and iterative optimization of local\nintelligence, and supporting intelligent perception, analysis, decision-making,\nand execution on local networks. NE AI can comprehensively detect network\nstatus in real time and perform inference, improving device-level autonomous\nanalysis and processing.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

Identify E2E service domains and closed loops that participate in a service chain\n⇾ ⇾\n2. Map customer requirements and experience requirements to : WHAT-IF scenarios\nTesting: SLA validation\n3. Program all resolution path, exception handling and escalations\n4. Create chaos monkeys to randomly throw exceptions and test the services\n5. Establish SLA\nRuntime: orchestration, assurance & optimization\n6. Allocate the resources on demand\n7. Monitor, prevent and provision the SLA in real time\n8. Optimize the usage per SLA\nSome cases are illustrated in IG1218A [11] and further realization studies are in\nIG1218C[12].\n5.3. Effectiveness indicators\nIt is important to measure the business value and service effectiveness of AN in terms\nof service growth, customer experience and operations efficiency. The value of these\nindicators lies in two aspects:\n1) Visualizing and quantifying the effectiveness and benefits of AN evolution and\n2) Aligning the development of autonomous capabilities with the enterprise strategy\nand service development trend.\nEffectiveness indicators are selected based on the Zero-X and Self-X visions.\nEffectiveness indicators and ANL are two key AN evaluation factors that jointly facilitate\nthe fulfillment of the AN vision.\n© TM Forum 2023.

China Mobile has been responding to the times, shouldering the main force of building\nstrength in cyberspace, enabling a digital China and a smart society, by establishing the main\ndevelopment path of \"promoting the digital and intelligent transformation and achieving high-\nquality development\" to accelerate the digitalization and intelligentization of network\noperation and maintenance domain, and strive to build an integrated, highly automated and\nintelligent system of cloud and network, giving full play to the core advantages of operators\nand consolidating the foundation of digitalization and intelligentization of all walks of life.\nUpholding and practicing the concepts of autonomous network, China Mobile sets an overall\ngoal for the company’s network to reach level 4 by 2025. The digitalization and\nintelligentization of network operation and maintenance is accelerated to empower the\nsupport of CHBN services, improve customer satisfaction, enhance network quality, increase\nmaintenance efficiency, reduce the operating cost and optimize management work. With the\ngoal of supporting end-to-end services, capabilities are established at different levels. With the\nstarting point of capability evaluation, iterative optimization is carried out in a close-loop\nmanner. On the one hand, driven by network management system planning, capacity of\noperation and maintenance automation is constructed through innovative pilots of intelligent\noperation and maintenance and their large-scale adoption, accelerating the AI injection and\nenabling. On the other hand, overall plans are made for issuing technical specifications of\nautomatic operation and maintenance support functions of network equipment, promoting\nthe capability improvement in conjunction with the network management system.\nAiming to guide more industry partners to build consensus, share experiences, and jointly\ninnovate to achieve the common goal of network autonomy, this article summarizes China\nMobile’s thinking and practices from the perspective of motivation and background, strategy\nand methodology, quantitative evaluation, etc. Combined with the company's follow-up\nplanning, it gives cooperation suggestions and future prospects of industrial development.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 6 of 23\nIG1218B China Mobile's Practice on Autonomous Networks v1.1.0\n1. Background and Motivation\n1.1. Background\nAccording to MIIT[1] and CAICT[2], China’s digital economy added value is supposed to reach\n65 trillion yuan by 2025, in which the income of information service industry will increase to\n20.4 trillion yuan. The digital economy will continue to grow at a high speed, showing a\ndevelopment trend of \"digital industrialization, industrial digitization, digital governance and\ndata’s value realization\". Advanced ICT technologies such as 5G, AI, cloud/edge computing are\ngetting more mature, integrated and innovative, empowering various verticals to deepen\ndigitalization. Enterprise customers focus on \"ubiquitous intelligent connection + cloud-based\ndata intelligence\", and are committed to implementing an end-to-end overall program to\npromote the development of digital economy in more fields and at a deeper level.\nIn this context, China Mobile has taken the initiative to build strength in cyberspace, enabling a\ndigital China and a smart society, and established the main path of development of \"\npromoting the digitalization and intelligentization and achieving high-quality development \" [1],\nvia five key actions: create innovative digital intelligent products, consolidate digital intelligent\nnetwork, build a digital intelligent center, construct a digital intelligent organization and forge\na digital intelligent ecosystem. Based on the communication network, driven by information\ntechnology and data elements, a new growth model is to be established, giving full play to the\n\"shoulder role\" of operators in promoting the innovation of information technology and the\ndeep integration of information technology with economy, society and people's livelihood.\nWith a complex network featured by world’s largest customer scale, rapid development of ICT\nbusiness and coexistence of 2/4/5G technologies, the digitalization and intelligentization is a\nMUST in China Mobile's network operation and maintenance domain. China Mobile is\ncommitted to build an integrated, highly automated and intelligent system of cloud and\nnetwork, which consolidates the foundation of digitalization and intelligentization of all walks\nof life.\n[1] Ministry of Industry and Information Technology\n[2] China Academy of Information and Communication Technology\n1.2. Motivation\nThe digitalization and intelligentization of network operation and maintenance is the deep\nintegration of automation and intelligence technology with the communication network’s\nhardware, software, system, process, etc., which promotes quality and efficiency\nimprovement, leads network technology reforms, and enables agile business innovation. The\ndriving force mainly comes from the three following aspects:\nRapid Expansion of Business: As the individual user market gets saturated, the digitalization of\nvertical industries and enterprise consumers' lives have become highly expected potential\ngrowth points. Diversified demands are put on network services with more stringent standards\nin terms of connectivity, bandwidth, delay, reliability, etc.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved.

The complexity of network collaboration\nincreases sharply, which further aggravates the difficulty of network operation and\nmaintenance management.\nOptimization for Operation Management: As one of the world’s largest telecom operators in\nterms of both network scale and users, China Mobile’s network is characterized by rich\ndomains, multiple generations, numerous levels and large region. The process coordination,\ninformation screening and automatic execution of existing O&M work such as service\nsubscription, fault monitoring and quality optimization need to be continuously improved in\nefficiency.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 8 of 23\nIG1218B China Mobile's Practice on Autonomous Networks v1.1.0\n2. Strategy and Methodology\n2.1. Overall Target\nTM Forum’s autonomous network[2] aims to provide vertical industries and consumers with\ninnovative network and ICT services featuring zero-wait, zero-contact, zero-fault and full\nautonomy, build a self-served, self-healing, and self-optimized communication network, which\nprovides a clear target architecture and implementation path for digitalization and\nintelligentization of network operation and maintenance[3].\nBased on the TM Forum framework, the network autonomy is classified into 6 levels: Level 0 -\nManual management, Level 1 – Assisted management, Level 2 - Partial autonomous network,\nLevel 3 - Conditional autonomous network, Level 4 - High autonomous network, Level 5 - Full\nautonomous network.\nWith reference to the concept of TM Forum’s autonomous network, China Mobile has made\nplans for digitalization and intelligentization of network operation and maintenance,\nstrengthened the capacity building of automation and intelligence, and set an overall goal for\ncompany’s autonomous network to reach Level 4 by 2025.\n2.2. Approach and Framework\nIn order to realize the overall goal by 2025, China Mobile has made all-round thinking,\napplicability exploration and phased practices. Faced with complex production networks and\ndiversified autonomous capabilities, the method of \"divide and conquer\" is adopted to realize\nthe \"spiral rise\" of network autonomous capability construction.\n2.2.1. Layered Target Framework\nWith reference to the hierarchical architecture of TM Forum network [4] and combined with\nproduction practices, China Mobile put forward an internal practice framework of \"4 layers\nand 3 closed loops\", as shown in Figure 1.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 9 of 23\nIG1218B China Mobile's Practice on Autonomous Networks v1.1.0\nFigure 1. China Mobile’s Autonomous Network Framework\nAs is shown in Figure 1, “the 4 layers” refer to:\n• Network Element Management: provides the built-in autonomous O&M capabilities of\nnetwork elements.\n• Network Management: provides network-oriented autonomous O&M capabilities within a\nsingle technical domain.\n• Service Management: provides cross-domain autonomous O&M capabilities toward\nnetwork and services.\n• Business Management: provides customer-oriented autonomous service management\nand customer touch-points uniformly.\n“The 3 closed loops” include:\n• Resource Closed Loop: resource management for single domain to achieve single domain\nautonomy.\n• Service Closed Loop: service-oriented, cross-domain end-to-end management to achieve\ncross-domain collaboration.\n• Customer Closed Loop: customer and business management including customer\ninformation, sales, billing, customer service, etc.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 10 of 23\nIG1218B China Mobile's Practice on Autonomous Networks v1.1.0\nTaking it as a reference, targeting at quality improvement, efficiency increase and cost\nreduction, China Mobile builds systematic capabilities at different levels to realize network\nautonomy.\n2.2.2. Evaluation Driven Evolution Loop\nIn view of multiple differences among provincial companies in customer scale, business type,\nO&M process, and supplier partnership, a unified evaluation system is developed, and a\ncomprehensive quantitative evaluation of autonomous capability is conducted in all 31\nprovincial companies, triggering the evaluation driven evolution loop to iteratively\naccumulating capability in three steps, as shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2. China Mobile’s autonomous network evolution loop\nLevel Evaluation and Shortcoming Identification: Based on the general principles of TMF\nevaluation framework, more detailed guidelines are proposed to evaluate scenario-based\nautonomy capability for O&M process. After grading all 31 provincial companies’ capability,\ncommon problems and shortcoming differences could be identified, targeted measures and\ndeployment plans could be developed.\nSystem Construction and Coordinated Planning: Unified plans are made for all provincial\ncompanies to strengthen and accelerate the renewal of new network management systems.\nThe function and technology specifications for network equipment in all domains are to be\nfurther detailed on the basis of general function specifications, guiding network equipment\nsuppliers to achieve upgrading for equipment autonomy.\nApplication Pilot and Scale Adoption: Provincial companies are guided to actively introduce\nadvanced automation and intelligent technologies, in collaboration with network equipment\nsuppliers and network management system integrators. Considering that there are differences\nin automation levels among provincial companies, pilots are carried out in selected provincial\ncompanies at early stages, and then be promoted nationwide if the feasibility were verified.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 11 of 23\nIG1218B China Mobile's Practice on Autonomous Networks v1.1.0\n2.3. 2.3 Methodology\n2.3.1. Objects for Scenario-based Evaluation\nCombined with the actual O&M management organization system of production network, the\nmodel of evaluation object framework for autonomous network is formed on three\ndimensions of \"O&M scenario, Network domain and Service category\", which includes\nspecifically:\nKey O&M Scenarios: 6 first-class scenarios, including: planning, development, maintenance,\noptimization, operation and resource management. 11 second-class core scenarios, including:\nnetwork planning, design and deployment, monitoring and troubleshooting, patrol inspection,\ntesting, network analysis, network optimization, service subscription, network complaints,\nresource change management and resource data management.\nKey Network Domains: Core network, Radio network, IP network, Transport network, and\nTelecom cloud.\nKey Service Categories: Individual services including mobile Internet, voice, SMS; home\nservices including home broadband Internet, IPTV; business services such as 5G industrial\nnetwork, APN, IMS, transport VPN, Internet VPN, transport VPN, cloud VPN, MPLS VPN.\nIn use of the methodology mentioned above, combined with the characteristics of each\nnetwork domain and service category, the second-class O&M scenarios are further\ndecomposed into a group of O&M core capability set as scenario-based evaluation objects.\n2.3.2. Capability Granularity Level Characteristics\nBased on the guiding principles of TM Forum network grading framework[5], combined with\nthe actual needs of network O&M management evaluation, from the perspective of guiding IT\nsystem implementation, the following requirements for different levels are defined:\n• Level 0: offline manual implementation.\n• Level 1: manual implementation, online recording.\n• Level 2: automatic implementation ruled by statically programmed rules.\n• Level 3: automatic implementation ruled by dynamically programmable policies.\n• Level 4: automatic implementation ruled by AI assisted (if needed) knowledge, featuring\nwith continuous learning and rapid evolution.\n• Level 5: automatic implementation capable of self-evolution and adapting to changes.\nApplying those level-differentiated features to core capability sets, the detailed classification\nrules of scenario-based autonomy for each core capability set are obtained. A quantitative\nevaluation model is proposed based on aggregation principles such as weighted average,\nwhich can help the company obtain the quantitative score of the network O&M autonomous\nlevel in each scenario, each process, each domain and cross-domain area as required from the\nfinest-grained evaluation results, providing powerful support for making all-round evaluations,\ncomprehensively analyzing the level differences in multiple dimensions and accurately\nidentifying common shortcomings.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 12 of 23\nIG1218B China Mobile's Practice on Autonomous Networks v1.1.0\n3. Innovative Practice\n3.1. Shortcoming Identification\nAll provincial companies are required to conduct network O&M capability evaluation through\nself-assessment in single domain, horizontal comparison of multiple domains, etc., so as to\nidentify the shortcomings. At present, the overall level of China Mobile's production network\n(for selected services, networks and operation domains) is rated as L1-L2, and some provincial\ncompanies as above L2.\nShortcomings in different degrees are identified in network equipment from various aspects\nincluding integrated deployment, potential risk prediction, fault isolation and failover,\noptimized simulation, sensing test, data reporting granularity and real-timeness.\nNetwork management system needs to be further strengthened on automatic and intelligent\nsupport capabilities in terms of end-to-end registration of home and enterprise services,\ncloud-network coordinative scheduling, end-to-end quality perception and analysis of services,\nand on-site manual operation support.\n3.2. Inner Capability Enhancement in Network Elements\nNetwork elements’ inherent support for automation and intelligence of operation and\nmaintenance lays the foundation to achieve autonomous network. The required automatic\nO&M capabilities of network element management layer for each domain include:\n(1)Equipment Monitoring: enhances the automatic data sensing capability with multiple-\ndimension, real-time and fine-grain, which includes traffic flow, resource capacity, topology,\noperation events, equipment energy consumption, etc.\n(2)Resource Allocation: speeds up the construction of dynamic routing calculation, service\nconfiguration activation and other capabilities in transport network, IP network, etc.\n(3)Service Guarantee: provides automatic diagnosis, isolation, migration and recovery of\nnetwork faults.\n(4)Service Optimization: ameliorates capabilities in optimizing resource utilization, business\nquality and energy efficiency.\n(5)Service Test: provides connectivity testing and service testing capabilities on network\nelement level, module level and link level in core network, transport network, etc.\n3.3. Platform Foundation for Network Management System\nIn terms of network management and service management, China Mobile proposed a \"2+5+N\"\nblueprint for network management system, guiding systematically the capacity building of\nnetwork management system, as shown in Figure 3. On the one hand, 2 core platforms and 5\ncapability centers are built to pull through the O&M process, complete the automation\nconfiguration activation, consolidate the data base, strengthen the end-to-end services\nguarantee, and achieve the reuse and sharing of capabilities. On the other hand, application of\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 23\nIG1218B China Mobile's Practice on Autonomous Networks v1.1.0\nemerging IT technologies will be further strengthened such as artificial intelligence, big data,\ncloud nativity, etc.\nFigure 3. China's Mobile's \"2+5+N\" blueprint for network management system\n(1)2 sharing platforms\nShared Data Platform: It provides unified data collection, storage and sharing in network\nmanagement domain.\nGeneral Capability Platform: It provides service-independent general platform capabilities and\nnetwork security management capabilities for all kinds of systems in network management\ndomain.\n(2)5 O&M capability centers\nService Orchestration Center: It achieves design and orchestration capability of high-level end-\nto-end process for service registration, coordinates the scheduling of cross-domain sub-\nprocesses, and provides a unified interface docking business operation system.\nResource Management Center: It realizes network resource data management, resource\naccess management, resource scheduling management, end-to-end resource topology view\nand other applications for all domains, and provides various resource services.\nFault Management Center: It implements centralized network monitoring and provides open\nnetwork monitoring capability.\nQuality Management Center: It makes end-to-end analysis of network and service quality, as\nwell as analysis on various topics.\nO&M Management Center: It provides centralized dispatching management of operation and\nmaintenance, as well as automatic dispatching and other services.\n© TM Forum 2021.

AI Capability Enhancement\nChina Mobile builds a four-layer relationship model of application, algorithm, data and\ncomputational power (as shown in Figure 4) around the four types of intelligent O&M\nscenarios including intelligent perception, intelligent diagnosis, intelligent prediction and\nintelligent control, actively carries out the innovation pilot and achievement promotion of AI\ntechnology in image recognition, big data analysis, complex computing and other O&M\ndomains.\nFigure 4. China Mobile's AI application system of intelligent O&M\nApplication Layer: Intelligent perception analyzes and assesses data and identifies network\nstatus through AI technology. Intelligent diagnosis takes input from faults, complaints and\npoor quality, in order to diagnose network problems. Intelligent Prediction is to estimate\nbusiness and capacity trends and predict network changes. Intelligent control is to work out\nnetwork optimization strategies and adjust network parameters.\nAlgorithm Layer: AI algorithms commonly used in the intelligent O&M domain, including voice\nrecognition, image processing, anomaly detection, relationship analysis, causal inference, time\nseries prediction, optimization analysis and other categories.\nData Layer: PB-level structured and unstructured network data generated by front-end\nservices, network management systems and network equipment.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 15 of 23\nIG1218B China Mobile's Practice on Autonomous Networks v1.1.0\nComputational Power Layer: deploy mixed computational power clusters to support large-\nscale heterogeneous parallel computing.\n3.5. Typical Application Cases\nChina Mobile adopts the R&D mode of \"self-development+cooperation\", in conjunction with\npartners, actively launches innovative pilots for the whole process of network O&M planning,\ndevelopment, maintenance, optimization and operation [6]. Every pilot application gets\npromoted promptly once it gets mature. Typical application cases include:\nIntelligent Acceptance of 5G Base Stations: Traditional completion and acceptance of base\nstations requires multiple manual inspection and long acceptance periods, highly dependent\non human experiences, adding difficulties to locate problems timely and accurately. In the\npeak period of 5G construction, the efficiency and quality of base station acceptance work\nmakes great difference. China Mobile has innovatively applied a new intelligent acceptance\nmode requiring \"no-boarding\", which is able to complete automatically 18 target detections\nwith 95% accuracy by means of identifying various pictures of wireless equipment installation\nprocess, equipment connection and computer room environment and facilities. Applying in\nZhejiang existing network, it has reduced single station acceptance time from 7 days to 1 hour.\nAutomatic Opening of Cloud-network Dedicated Line: Traditional opening of cloud-network\ndedicated lines relies on manual configuration of O&M personnel, involving multiple steps\nincluding business analysis, resource exploration, instruction writing, verification and testing,\netc. It usually takes several days to make an end-to-end opening. Based on SR-TE technology\nand time series prediction algorithm, China Mobile establishes the automatic opening\ncapability by adopting containerized and micro-service architecture, sensing real-time network\nstatus, proactively predicting business trends, dynamically calculating the optimal path and\nautomatically configuring network equipment. With its wide adoption on the whole network,\nthe whole process from front-end business acceptance to back-end cloud private network\nconfiguration and distribution is completed with zero contact, and the opening time is\nshortened to minutes, which significantly improves the satisfaction of enterprise customers.\nAutomatic Handling of 5G Faults: With the rapid growth of 5G network scale, average daily\nnetwork alarms from provincial companies exceed 10 million, involving multiple network\ndomains, long collaborative chain and complex dependency relationship. China Mobile has\nbuilt a fault management framework with comprehensive real-time sensing, alarm correlation\nand compression, automatic diagnosis anomaly, cross-domain accurate positioning and\nintelligent decision-making, enabling a series of capabilities including the all visual network\nquality monitoring capability, the large-capacity alarm processing capability of 2000 alarms per\nsecond, the alarm compression and dispatch capability of 1000:1, the automatic diagnosis\ncapability of 300 types of fault scenarios, and the network configuration capability of 800\nflexible combinations. With its applying in the existing network in Zhejiang, main faults can be\ncleared within 30 minutes, with average processing efficiency remarkably increased by 40%,\nwhich effectively guarantees the quality of 5G network and provides customers with the\nultimate experience.\nIntelligent Diagnosis of 5G Voice Quality: At early stages of 5G development, 5G voice services\ngenerally fall back to 4G, with signaling switches frequently between 4/5G. The problem of\npoor 5G voice quality involves more than 10 types of network equipment, 50 more data\ninterfaces and is quiet difficult to accurately diagnose and quickly dealt with. China Mobile has\ndeveloped the ability of intelligent quality difference location, horizontally pulls through multi-\ndimensional index data such as KPI of network performance and KQI of user perception,\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 16 of 23\nIG1218B China Mobile's Practice on Autonomous Networks v1.1.0\ndeeply extracts the quality characteristics of 5G voice service, proactively warns the potential\nrisks of 5G voice quality degradation based on time series prediction model, and accurately\nlocates the root cause of quality difference based on FP-growth correlation analysis model.\nApplying in Beijing's existing network, it helped reducing 5G voice fault location time to\nminutes, increased the processing efficiency by 60%.\nIntelligent Diagnosis of Network Quality for Home Broadband Services: Existing problems\nsuch as insensitive perception, inaccurate positioning and untimely processing, could greatly\naffect the user experience of home broadband services. China Mobile has developed an end-\nto-end quality analysis application for it, using Xgboost algorithm to analyze the various code\nstream of videos and games traffic in real time, finely identify traffic types, and perceive the\nquality problem of different traffic according to the preset differential threshold. For the link\ndiagnosed with poor quality, spectral clustering algorithm is used to analyze the performance\nindex such as optical current, power, bit error rate and so on, quickly locating the end-to-end\nnetwork problems. After being applied in Henan existing network, 450,000 cases of poor\nquality problems, 8,000 poor quality lines and 150 poor quality content sources were actively\nidentified. The diagnostic rate reached 90%. The network problems were dealt with ahead of\ncustomer complaints, which effectively improved the satisfaction of home broadband services.\n5G Intelligent Power Saving: Energy consumption per bit of 5G is lower than that of 4G, but\nlargely improved throughput has arisen an overall energy consumption, bringing huge added\ncost to network operation. Based on expert experience, the traditional energy-saving method\nof base stations sets a fixed night energy-saving time window for idle base stations. However,\nfacing numerous base stations, each with various wireless environment and service load,\ntogether with their highly coupled relations, it is impossible to achieve refined energy-saving\nby one single set of static energy-saving strategies. China Mobile developed 4/5G intelligent\nenergy-saving technology of \"one scheme for one station\", which used time series prediction\nalgorithm to actively predict the service trends according to the historical service volume and\nthe dynamic features of user distribution, calculate the optimal configuration scheme in real\ntime, and automatically control the energy-saving parameters of the cell. After being applied\nin Jiangsu existing network, energy consumption saving of base station is further improved\nfrom 8% to 11%, which effectively saves the network operation cost.\nIntelligent Air Conditioner in Data Center: Energy saving of large data center is an important\nwork for China Mobile to realize low-carbon innovation, reduce costs and increase efficiency.\nUsually, high-cost hardware optimization schemes are adopted such as upgrading air-\nconditioning equipment and optimizing refrigeration architecture. In terms of software it is\ndifficult to find out the software optimization scheme quickly by manual statistical analysis\nmethod due to more than 1,000 parameter combinations in IDC air conditioning system. China\nMobile developed the \"Smart Cooling\" IDC air-conditioning system, which adopts multi-index\ntime-space series prediction and deep neural network algorithm, actively predicts the\nsubsequent operating conditions and air-conditioning energy consumption according to the\nhistorical data of outdoor temperature and humidity, cooling demand and air-conditioning\nenergy consumption, automatically finds the best air-conditioning parameter scheme, and\ndynamically optimizes the operating parameters in real time. After applying the system in\nAnhui existing network, energy consumption of data center refrigeration is reduced by 8%, and\neach data center saves 140,000 kWh per month, which tremendously reduces carbon\nemissions.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 17 of 23\nIG1218B China Mobile's Practice on Autonomous Networks v1.1.0\n4. Industrial Co-Creation\nAlthough the practice of China Mobile's autonomous network construction has entered the\nstage of systematic deployment, there is still a long way to go for the L4 goal. Only by joint\nefforts can we lead the industry to achieve common goals. Hence these 4 cooperative\ninitiatives are proposed:\nReach Consensus on Target Architecture: To achieve the high-level goal of autonomous\nnetwork, it is necessary to lead the coordinative evolution of network and network\nmanagement system under the guidance of a unified architecture and on the basis of active\npractice and verification. A sound management system needs to be established for digital\nknowledge assets such as business rules, expert experience, AI models, etc. All parties in the\nindustry are guided to establish a cross-organization cooperation platform for the whole\nprocess of building the network automation capability system [7], promote common\nadvancement of network equipment and network management system, and implement in all\nrespects of network planning, development, maintenance, optimization and operation. It is\nproposed that all industry standards organizations will strengthen communication and\ncooperation in terms of the target framework, unified evaluation model and technical path of\nautonomous network, promote mutual recognition of achievements, enhance\ncomplementarity, jointly draw a common blueprint and build a common set of standards.\nEnhance Business Driving Forces: The ultimate goal of autonomous network construction is to\nsupport the growth of operators' business. During this process, we must always strengthen the\nevolution of network and network management automation capability driven by business, and\nadvance in an orderly manner around the four major markets, namely, C (individual\nCustomer), H (Home customer), B (Business/enterprise customer) and N (New customer), so as\nto realize the coordinated development. In practice, China Mobile needs to cooperate closely\nwith network equipment suppliers and network management system integrators, achieving\nsteady improvement of various business support capabilities of CHBN, promoting value\nmanagement with high-quality and differentiated guarantee, empowering business\ndevelopment and improving O&M efficiency.\nPool Ecological Strength: Continuously improving the level of network autonomy involves the\ngradual transfer of network O&M responsibilities from people to network equipment and\nO&M systems, and expansion of the basis for system decision-making from interpretable\nexperience to artificial intelligence algorithm models that are difficult to understand\nintuitively, which is not a simple technical problem. As the pioneer of autonomous network\nbuilding, China Mobile is eager to join hands with industrial organizations, network equipment\nsuppliers, network management system integrators, research institutes and other internal and\nexternal innovative R&D forces to jointly explore the deep integration, theoretical innovation\nand engineering realization of advanced technologies including communication network and\nAICDE[1], and realize the goal of digitalization and intelligentization of network operation and\nmaintenance. It is proposed that each partner of \"industry, education, academia and\napplication\", based on their respective expert fields, will enhance the cross-domain horizontal\ncollaboration in multiple fields, push for the cross-domain (horizontal) and cross-level (vertical)\ncollaboration, and make joint efforts to create an open innovation platform that is business\nleading, application driven, technology empowered and brings win-win for all parties.\n© TM Forum 2021.

Page 18 of 23\nIG1218B China Mobile's Practice on Autonomous Networks v1.1.0\nShare Industrial Growth: Predicted by Tractica/Ovum, total investment on AI software,\nhardware and services from global telecom industry will reach 36.7 billion USD by 2025, and\nnetwork /IT operation monitoring and management will become the largest AI application in\ntelecom industry, accounting for 61% of AI expenditure in telecom industry. As a telecom\nenterprise with the largest number of customers, the largest network scale, the most complex\nnetwork architecture and the most abundant network services in the world, China Mobile\nwishes to give full play to company’s advantages to promote the implementation of\nautonomous network, realize the scale benefits of cost reduction, efficiency improvement and\nquality improvement for its own good, set an exceptional example for the digitalization and\nintelligentization of the communication industry, and provide practical support for the\nstandard system of the autonomous network.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 23\nIG1218B China Mobile's Practice on Autonomous Networks v1.1.0\n5. Future Outlook\nIn 2019, China Mobile began to promote collaboration of related standards organizations,\nopen source communities, and industrial forums. In May 2019, China Mobile jointly issued the\nTM Forum Autonomous Network White Paper[2][9]. One year later, serving as Chairman of the\nBoard of Directors of Linux Network Foundation, it initiated an industrial research toward\ndemands, strategies and applications of intelligent network O&M. Since February 2021, China\nMobile has been actively contributing to the autonomous network standard development in\nTM Forum in terms of level evaluation of autonomous networks[10] and cross-organization\nstandard collaboration[7] .\nLooking forward, China Mobile will continue to exert its influence in international standards,\nopen source community and industrial cooperation, as well as promote industrial partners\nincluding industrial organizations, network equipment suppliers, network management system\nintegrators and third-party R&D institutions to reach consensus, make joint efforts and unite\nforces, to accelerate the innovation of products, solutions and business models, speed up the\ncreation of autonomous network capabilities, enabling digitalization of society, quality\nimprovement and benefits generation of services, and cost reduction and efficiency increase of\nO&M, helping digital economy construction and digitalization and intelligentization of various\nindustries.\n© TM Forum 2021.

This guide describes scenario realizations of operator\nuse cases using an autonomy mindset and, in particular, the mechanisms described in the AN\ntechnical architecture (IG1230). Using closed control feedback and intent-driven interactions,\nwe can deploy smart software to continuously monitor and optimize the networks.\nAutonomous Networks have become a prerequisite for many more advanced use-cases. For\nexample, with 5G and Software-Defined Networks, often the topology of the network itself is\ndynamic: higher-level application services dynamically change their network requirements in\nthe same way as cloud-computing applications elastically change their compute requirements.\nAutonomous Networks can enable concepts like Digital Twins that allow you to model and\ndynamically simulate changes to a Network to de-risk such changing requirements.\nAnother example is for mission-critical services that require the network to be “in the loop”.\nAn Autonomous Network can interact with the higher-level mission-critical service through\nAPIs to warn of potential service interruptions. An autonomous vehicle could, for example, be\nwarned about crossing an international/roaming boundary and the vehicle could adopt a\nlimited-network mode where it drives more slowly. For industries like healthcare, aviation, and\ntransport, Autonomous Networks must support the move from “best-effort” networks to\nultra-reliable “network-in-the-loop” services. This section describes several real-world\nexamples of where operator use cases and requirements were realized using the core\nconcepts of the AN technical architecture.\n© TM Forum 2021.

(TM Forum Catalyst 2020)\nElectric vehicle charging infrastructure business continuity solution\nChampions BT, Orange, Telecom Italia\nParticipants MDS Group (BSS/CRM)\nIncognito Software Systems (OSS/Service Activation)\nTEOCO (OSS/Service Assurance)\nHuawei (Network Technology and Management)\n3.1 Customer Requirements\n1) The EV charging customer journey is both a physical journey and an online journey and\ninvolves a complex business ecosystem (see Figure 3-3) to make it work. The\necosystem is heavily reliant on connectivity services, and oftentimes communication\nissues (especially outages) won't go unnoticed by customers. This challenge presents a\ndifferentiation opportunity for those who have continuity plans for all scenarios.\nConnectivity and connectivity related services are needed to enable the EV charging\ncustomer journey in several ways:\n• Finding nearby public charge points and checking their availability, connector\ncompatibility, charge level, and in some cases: booking a charging time slot.\n• [In the event the driver is outside their local area] navigating to the selected public\ncharge point using one of the many mobile navigation apps (Google Maps,\nTomTom Go, HERE WeGo, Sygic, etc.)\n• Performing a payment pre-authorization to unlock the EV charging station\nequipment. This is a key difference with the gasoline-based car industry: network\nconnectivity is not required to pump gas, it is for the electric car industry (the one\nexception being home charger).\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 11 of 12\nAutonomous Networks Scenario Realizations v1.1\nFigure 3-1 EV Charging Ecosystem\nIf any of the above have an issue they can debilitate the EV charging customer journey, and\nresult in lost revenue for charge point station operators. This has consequences across the\nbroader ecosystem. Thus, a differentiated business continuity solution offering from a CSP (or\neven a group of CSPs working together) can help better address these pain points and enable a\nsmoother customer experience.\nThe solution addresses two requirements addressed by different autonomous services, as\noutlined in Table 1. Note that the business capabilities are per reference guide [IG1218], and\nthe Self-X capability applies to all of them.\n3.2 AN Business Capabilities needed to support Services\nTable 1 EV Charging infrastructure requirements, metrics, and business capabilities\nService Autonomous Network Requirements, Metrics, & Business Capabilities\nUser Business Service Network/ICT\nperspective perspective perspective perspective\nSelf-X\nRequirements Requirements Requirements Requirements\nAssured • Find local EV • Advertise • Provide reliable • Provide on-\nlocation- charging points and Chargepoint and secure demand\nbased their latest status, connectivity for onboarding of\n© TM Forum 2021.

All Rights Reserved. Page 14 of 15\nAutonomous Networks Scenario Realizations v1.1\n- Online service selection and information: EV drivers can use a mobile or in-car\ndashboard application to locate the nearest charging stations providing charging\nservices. Drivers can also see all details and status of the chargepoint infrastructure\n(e.g., what type of connectors are supported, how much power is available to\ndischarge, usage state)\n- Online service ordering: EV drivers can use a mobile or in-car dashboard application to\nbook a timeslot at a specific chargepoint.\n- Zero-touch payment: EV drivers can swipe a fob or card to authenticate for payment.\nThe chargepoint then communicates over the network to the chargepoint management\nsystem which authenticates the account and subsequently unlocks the chargepoint.\nThe charge to the customer account is applied after the vehicle has been charged.\n- After the charge is completed the customer can opt to receive an email with a sales\nreceipt.\n- Agile deployment： The AN stack uses all-scenario automation capabilities to\nimplement intelligent service orchestration, resource orchestration, and process\norchestration, improving network deployment agility and implementing process\nscheduling and orchestration of atomic capabilities. Automated modeling from service\nrequirements to slice and MEC resources, automatic online network resource\nevaluation, one-click slice deployment, and automatic slice configuration, automated\nservice testing quickly implements automatic closed loop in all scenarios during\nnetwork O&M and meets the requirements of agile provisioning of electric power\nservices in the industry market.\n- Intelligent O&M： The AN stack uses technologies such as neural networks and\nknowledge graphs to automatically provide optimal intelligent O&M policies. It uses\nML-derived dynamic thresholds, KPI association analysis, and automatic sub-health\ndetection to detect and provide notification of faults in advance, and AI-based fast\nfault locating and slice self-healing.\n- Intelligent failover: The AN stack performs self-monitoring of both fixed and wireless\nnetworks involved in the business continuity solution. In the event of a fixed network\noutage, a wireless network slice is available and self-scaling is used to grow the size of\nthe slice as needed, maximizing resource efficiency. If the geographical area of the\nfixed network outage grows the AN will perform automatic resource matching with the\nwireless network and automatically adds the relevant wireless to the scope of the\nnetwork slice.\n- Network outage prediction: AI-based network performance functions within the AN use\nweather and other IoT sensor data to make predictions on future weather conditions\non how it will impact the network and network services.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 15 of 16\nAutonomous Networks Scenario Realizations v1.1\n- Auto application onboarding: At service order time the AN keeps a record of the\nmobile application used to serve consumers charging point information. This\napplication would normally run in a centralized public cloud. If a network outage\nprediction is made that is deemed to impact the EV charging infrastructure the\napplication is onboarded into the appropriate MEC data centers.\n- Zero-trust DDoS in MEC: Within wireless and core networks there are backoff and\naccess barring mechanisms that detect and prevent denial of service attacks. These\nmechanisms are governed by configuration. AI algorithms can be used to further\noptimize these parameters in the event of ever more sophisticated attacks.\n3.4 Business Capabilities\nTo address the pain points and challenges mentioned, the following business capabilities are\nprovided. While the term not mentioned explicitly below these are fortified with “Zero X”\ncapabilities in the context of AN.\nCustomer management: This capability provides the ability to control, predict, process,\norganize, present, and analyze all information, documents, preferences, experiences, and\nhistory related to an individual or organization that has, plans to have, or has had an account\nwith the business. It encompasses several other detailed capabilities such as definition,\nauthentication and authorization, preference management, portfolio management, customer\nmatching, and customer information management. A few (not all) are mentioned below.\nCustomer authentication and authorization: This capability provides the ability to verify\ncustomer identity and access rights in the context of a given business scenario and allow a\ncustomer to proceed based on those rights or otherwise prevent the customer from\nproceeding.\nCustomer information management: This capability provides the ability to organize, track,\nreport on or otherwise disseminate attributes, data, and other perspectives about a customer.\nOrder management: This capability provides the ability to place, validate, cancel, change,\ntrack, fulfill, and otherwise manage a request by one party to another to buy, sell, or exchange\ngoods or services.\nIncident management: The capability provides the ability to detect, collect data on, organize,\nrespond and remediate reported troubles/incidents.\nProduct management: The capability provides the ability to conceptualize, design, develop,\nbundle, price, launch, maintain and retire goods and services offered by the business.\nNetwork management: The capability provides the ability to design the architecture and plan,\ndevelop, deploy, monitor, and report on the network infrastructure. It encompasses several\nother detailed capabilities such as design, lifecycle management, performance management,\ncompliance management, access management, A few (not all) are mentioned below.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 16 of 17\nAutonomous Networks Scenario Realizations v1.1\nNetwork design: This capability provides the ability to conceptualize, specify, and model\nfeatures that a network should have. From an AN perspective, the designs would be\nautomatically generated based on network intent and verified.\nNetwork compliance management: in addition to customer and service intent there are also\nother business requirements to comply with local rules, e.g., EMF emissions in wireless\nnetworks. These would be fed into the business layer and implemented within the wireless\nautonomous domain.\nNetwork matching: This provides the capability of locating the appropriate resource instances\nwith which to deliver the network intent.\n3.5 Using the AN Framework\nFigure 3-2 5G Ride On! 2020 Catalyst using AN Framework\nFigure 3-2 shows how the AN framework can be applied to a specific business objective,\nnamely business continuity. The need for resilience connectivity to provide reliable services\nwas the key focus. The Charge Point Operators as CSP customer is connected to the network\nusing cross-layer customer loop. The vendors provided the system platforms that realized Self-\nX capabilities and closed loops required. The network is organized into three separate\nautonomous domains, namely Access, Transport, and Edge-Core. Self-healing and Self-\nprotection within Fixed and Wireless access using 5G, with MEC orchestration and MEC\noffloading for self-optimization in the Edge Domain.\n© TM Forum 2021.

Page 17 of 18\nAutonomous Networks Scenario Realizations v1.1\n4 Use Cases using AN Level Evaluation\nMethodology\nThis section now describes two use case examples that apply the AN Level evaluation\nmethodology described in IG1230.\n4.1 Level Evaluation for IPRAN Assurance\nThis section selects the monitoring and troubleshooting of the IPRAN network of mobile 2C\nservice as an example to describe the Autonomous Network Level. The monitoring and\ntroubleshooting process is one of the most important processes in CSP network O&M. The full\nautonomy of the monitoring and troubleshooting process can reduce the workload of\npersonnel and lower the skill requirements for O&M personnel, the troubleshooting duration\ncan be shortened to improve end-user experience. Operation process and operation tasks for\nthe IPRAN network of mobile 2C service are divided into the monitoring and troubleshooting\noperation process into nine operation tasks.\nTask A: Intent Translation. Based on the monitoring and assurance requirements and SLA\nassurance policies, determine network monitoring rules, such as the monitored area,\nmonitored object (such as NEs or services), alarm type, alarm severity, KPI type, and alarm\nreporting policy for KPI exceptions. The system monitors the network based on the network\nmonitoring rules.\nTask B: Fault identification. Monitors and analyzes network operation data and external data\nto detect unexpected service interruptions or service quality deterioration promptly.\nTask C: Potential Risk Prediction. Monitors and analyzes network operation data and external\ndata, predicts the trend of network software and hardware status, and detects potential\nexceptions in advance.\nTask D: Problem Demarcation. Demarcate faults based on the identified faults and potential\nrisks. In the cross-domain scenario, demarcate the fault to a specific technical domain. In the\nsingle-domain scenario, demarcate the fault to a specific NE.\nTask E: Root cause location. Based on the problem demarcation result, further locate the\nspecific software and hardware causes (such as configurations, boards, and optical modules) of\nthe problem to support the generation of rectification solutions and rectify services as soon as\npossible.\nTask F: Recovery solution generation. Based on the fault demarcation and locating results,\ngenerate several alternative recovery solutions, such as modifying configurations, restarting\nNEs, replacing boards, and isolating NEs.\nTask G: Solution evaluation and decision-making. Evaluate the repair solution (such as\nwhether the solution can solve the problem, whether the repair cost is acceptable, and the\nextra impact on the network), and provide the optimal solution.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 18 of 19\nAutonomous Networks Scenario Realizations v1.1\nTask H: Recovery solution implementation. Recovery faults and eliminate potential risks\nbased on the optimal solution. For example, deliver configurations to the network for software\nfaults, isolate NEs or links for hardware faults, or replace or remove boards or optical modules\nonsite.\nTask I: Service verification. After fault recovery and risk elimination are performed, verify and\nconfirm the execution results, such as whether service interruption, quality deterioration, and\nalarms and KPI exceptions are cleared.\n6.1.1 Task Criteria for monitoring and troubleshooting of IPRAN network of mobile 2C services\nEach task can be completed manually by a human operator, or jointly by the operator and the\nsystem, or fully automatically by the system. The following table lists the monitoring and\ntroubleshooting autonomous level standards based on the division of Manual and system：\nTable 2 Level Evaluation for monitoring and troubleshooting of IPRAN\nLevel0： All monitoring and troubleshooting tasks are manually completed.\nLevel1： Problem identification (Task B), Problem Demarcation ( Task D), Root cause\nanalysis( Task E), recovery solution implementation (Task H), and Services\nverification( Task I) are completed by manual and systems (for example, automatic data\ncollection and manual fault identification).\nLevel2： Based on level 1, Recovery solution implementation (Task H) can be completed\nautomatically by the system.\nLevel3： Problem identification (Task B), Problem Demarcation (Task D), recovery solution\nimplementation (Task H), and service verification (Task I) can be automatically completed\nby the system.\nLevel4： All other tasks except Intent Translation (Task A) are automated.\nLevel5： All tasks are automatically completed by the system.\n© TM Forum 2021.

Based on the average method, the autonomous level of\nthe monitoring and troubleshooting of the IPRAN network of mobile 2C service is 1.9. The\nProblem identification task and Problem Demarcation task are highly automated. The system\ncollects network alarm, performance, and topology data and automatically aggregates and\nanalyzes the data to accurately identify and demarcate problems.\n4.2 Level Evaluation for HBB Intelligent O&M\nThis section selects Monitoring and troubleshooting of the Home & Access & Metro network\nfor home broadband service (HBB O&M) as an example to describe the Autonomous Network\nLevel. The HBB O&M analysis, task description, task capability criteria, etc. are for reference,\nand some need to be further researched.\nHome broadband (HBB) maintenance is to ensure the voice, Internet, video services, etc.,\nwhich are carried by the HBB network, it involves fault reporting, network monitoring, network\nfault handling, network risk check, and potential risk elimination, etc. The following shows the\nrequirement architecture of home broadband O&M.\nNetwork-based complaints rising generally go through three phases: Network\nRisk/Degradation, Network fault, and User complaint. Customers' requirements and network\nmaintenance focus vary across those phases.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved.

All Rights Reserved. Page 22 of 23\nAutonomous Networks Scenario Realizations v1.1\nFigure 4-3 Fault Prediction and Prevention workflow\nThe workflow of proactive faults prediction and prevention use case begins with operation\nintent. The system receives operation intent from the human operator and translates it into\noperational rules. These rules specify how the system runs to achieve the goal of operation\nintent. And the system organizes serial tasks to implement the operation rules. Typically, the\ntasks can be classified into 4 types: Awareness, Analysis, Decision, and Execution as shown in\nFigure 4-3. The tasks form a closed control loop with network devices to continuously ensure\nthe achievement of operation intent. The tasks of this use case are listed as follows:\nTable 5 Task of UC1-“HBB Fault Prediction and Prevention”\nTask Name Function description for UC1\nTask A Intention Based on the monitoring and assurance requirements and SLA\nTranslation assurance policies, determine network monitoring rules, such as the\nmonitored area, monitored object (such as NEs or services), alarm type,\nalarm severity, KPI type, and alarm reporting policy for KPI exceptions.\nThe system monitors the network based on the network monitoring\nrules.\nTask B Fault Not Applicable. This UC is for phase 1 which before network fault\nIdentification rising based on the Figure - Home broadband O&M requirements\narchitecture.\nTask C Potential risk Detection and data collection: Detects network and home broadband\nPrediction service risks and degradations, and collects related data, such as alarms,\nperformance, configurations, logs, and STB probes.\nPotential risk identification: Predicts the trend of network software and\nhardware status and identifies the potential risk of HBB service.\nException event filtering: Removes noises. For example, filter out\nabnormal events caused by normal user behaviors.\nTask D Problem Demarcate the risk and degradation event to a specific technical\nDemarcation domain, for HBB network should be Terminals, Home network, Access\nnetwork, Metro network, CDN network.\nTask E Root cause Based on the problem demarcation result, further locate the specific\nLocation software and hardware causes (such as configurations, boards, and\noptical modules) of the problem to support the generation of recovery\nsolutions.\n© TM Forum 2021.

Page 7 of 8\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nOverview\nOne of the main drivers for automation in communications service providers’ (CSPs’) networks is the urgent\nneed to reduce complexity so that they can lower operating costs. This is especially important as networks\nbecome software-defined and 5G is deployed. Even more importantly, CSPs must automate their networks\nand operations to deliver rapid service adaptation and deployment, with the dual objectives of improving\ncustomer satisfaction and increasing revenue. A new TM Forum project is addressing the complex business\nissues surrounding both, along with solving technical challenges.\nUsing artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, CSPs are aiming to fully automate the lifecycle of the\nservices they deliver to end customers and of internal network services, which are chains of technical\ncomponents. Increasingly, both kinds of services are being delivered across a diverse ecosystem of partners\nthat can include not only multiple CSPs but also many network component suppliers and third-party\napplication providers. The idea is to abstract the network as a set of software services and then use intent,\nautomated closed control loops, and machine learning to make networks and operations self-configuring,\nself-optimizing, self-organizing, self-healing, and self-evolving.\nThe purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be\nabsolutely precise. (E.W. Dijkstra)1\nThese abstractions are catalogued and explained in this document as part of an overall AN blueprint, to\nguide operators in the building and measuring of the autonomous capabilities in their platforms and\nnetworks.\nImplementing automation is both a business and technical innovation challenge that will need a small\nnumber of straightforward implementation and integration patterns to achieve self-organizing autonomous\nnetworks. These must be agreed upon and adopted by all the players.\nTo do this work, TM Forum established the TM Forum Autonomous Networks Project, which began with\nthe publication of a white paper called Autonomous Networks: Empowering Digital Transformation for the\nTelecoms Industry. Members from BT, China Mobile, Ericsson, Huawei, Orange and Telstra collaborated on\nthe paper and presented it at Digital Transformation World 2019 and the team has grown to include\nmembers from over 30 different organizations around the world.\n1The Humble Programmer by Edger W.

The autonomous domain\ndoes this by realizing self-management capabilities using a closed control\nloop mechanism, using four key phases: awareness, analysis, decision-\nmaking, and execution. It is a domain with an administrative governance\nboundary that defines the scope of encapsulated autonomous behaviors.\nAutonomous An Autonomous Network is a system of networks and software platforms\nNetwork that are capable of sensing its environment and adapting its behavior\naccordingly with little or no human input.\nAutonomous The collection of concepts described in this document that enable\nNetwork automation, agility and intelligence in innovation by CSPs and vendors and\nFramework simplified network and IT Platform architecture for integration &\noperations.\nThe ultimate goal is NOT automation, but rather simplification for ALL\nusers.\nBased on words in the scope section 1.2. but does that not capture the\nBusiness and Service platform concept.\nAccountability Accountability requires the AI and people behind the AI to explain, justify,\nand take responsibility for any decision and action made by the\nAI. Mechanisms, such as governance and tools, are necessary to achieve\naccountability.3\nBusiness A Business Service is a service that is delivered to business customers by\nService business units. For example, delivery of financial services to customers of a\nbank, or goods to the customers of a retail store. Successful delivery of\nbusiness services often depends on one or more IT services. A business\nservice may consist almost entirely of an IT service – for example, an\nonline banking service or an external website where product orders can be\nplaced by business customers.\nResponsibility The opportunity or ability to act independently and take decisions without\nauthorization. Oxford Dictionary\nIntent A set of operational goals that a network should meet and outcomes that a\nnetwork is supposed to deliver, defined in a declarative manner without\nspecifying how to achieve or implement them\nControl Loop Control loops are used to enable autonomous systems to adapt their\nbehavior to respond to changes in user needs, business goals, or\nenvironmental conditions.\nClosed Loop Autonomous system accomplishes a task without human taking an active\nrole during task execution. Also referred to as a Closed Control Loop.\n2 First reference to term in networking was to ‘Autonomic Computing’ by Kephart and Chess (IBM, 2003) a was\ndefined as ‘computing systems that can manage themselves given high-level objectives from administrators.\n3 LF-AI Trusted AI principles\n© TM Forum 2021.

It is\na good practice to qualify a domain, e.g., security domain, ODA Domain.\nOriginally from TMF263F “Relationships between the concepts of Domain\nand Platform”\nInterpretability Interpretability is about the extent to which a cause and effect can be\nobserved within a system.\nExplainability Explainability is the extent to which the internal mechanics of a machine or\ndeep learning system can be explained in human terms. (Sometimes\nconfused with Interpretability) Interpretability is about being able to\ndiscern the mechanics without necessarily knowing why. Explainability is\nbeing able to quite literally explain what is happening.\nAgent A Human or a Machine in the context of AN. An agent is an intelligent\nentity that runs independently, acts by itself, is affected by external\nenvironments, continuously detect from the environment to improve its\ncapabilities, and combines inference and knowledge representation, it has\nthe characteristics of autonomy, reactivity, adaptability, communication,\nand self-learning\nMachine Getting computers to learn from data in the form of observations and real-\nLearning (ML) world interactions in order to create a model of the real-world.\nML Pipeline A set of logical entities (each with specific functionalities) that can be\ncombined to form an analytics function (ITU)\nManagement Management Domain class represents a special grouping of\nDomain ManagedEntities that has two important properties.

In the case of complex communication networks, Level 5 seems to\nbe quite some distance away from happening and as of now, no CSPs have achieved this level. In some\nscenarios, Level 5 may not even be desirable given regulations, but no one can argue that the journey\ntowards full autonomy is not a challenge! And as is typically the case, it is exactly these difficult challenges\nwhere the real value lies for the entire telecom ecosystem. We are undertaking this journey towards self-\ndriving networks so that we can gain capabilities that we don’t possess currently. Some of the self-\nmanagement capabilities have been described in the AN business requirements and framework guide\n[IG1218] and we recap on these briefly in the next section and describe the strategy behind autonomous\nnetworks.\nTM Forum members are collaborating in the Autonomous Networks Project to develop a common\nunderstanding of what defines autonomous networks and build a consensus about how to implement\nthem.\n1.2 Scope\nIn May 2019, TM Forum published a whitepaper on Autonomous Networks on the autonomous network\nconcept and a level of autonomy classification for the automation of intelligent operations. The whitepaper\nsets out the business drivers for CSPs to go beyond simple automation to autonomy and describes both the\nchallenges and opportunities – principally automation, simplified network architecture enabling efficient\nintelligent operations, and rapid and agile integration of intelligent network innovation by CSPs and\nvendors. The ultimate goal is not automation, but rather simplification for all users. The whitepaper defines\na high-level conceptual Autonomous Network Framework together with a 6 Level classification for\nautonomous networks and their application to scenarios.\nSome key characteristics of the Autonomous Network are as follows:\n• AN is about services, operations, simplified network architecture.\n• AN is service-agnostic and technology agnostic.\n• The Framework does not focus on specific “technologies” such as AI.\n© TM Forum 2021.

The\nobjective of this guide is to take develop a concrete technical architecture of the Framework so that we go\ndeeper into how the architecture can be realized in real projects and implementations (see Figure 1-1).\nFigure 1-1 Framework to Technical Architecture\nThis document defines a Technical Architecture that when implemented:\n• Realizes the AN Business Architecture requirements including layering, closed control loop within\nand across Autonomous Domains, and exhibits ‘Self X’ capabilities.\n• Are ‘Agile by Design’ using configuration - rather than coding to define an AN system solution.\n• Uses a simple AN Domain model that can be realized and combined in many ways (akin to building\nwith Lego™ blocks which have a simple form that can be combined to create complex\nimplementations).\n• Allows varied combinations of AN Domains and associated control loops such that they can be\nsimply combined to realize complex AN systems.\n• Allows heterogeneous technology implementations to be combined and simply integrated to enable\ninnovation and evolution.\nIn the short to medium-term organizations face challenges related to efficiency. They need to reach new\nlevels of operational efficiency – i.e., to do more with the same level of budget.\nThe strategy map (Figure 1-2)explores the business drivers of the high-level AN Framework. The financial\nperspective of the AN strategy is referred to here as the Business Perspective and the key sub-goals are\nthose of Increased Efficiency and Increased Revenue. The value proposition of the improved customer\nexperience is represented in the Customer Perspective, and this is what influences how well we can achieve\nour overall objectives.\n© TM Forum 2021.

AI solutions without these AN technical concepts will lead to the\ntactical use of AI solutions with coupling between the CSP operations and the decision-making in Domains\nwhich will greatly inhibit lasting operation agility and flexibility.\nSome of the challenges of Traditional Network Management include:\n• Complex and time consuming to specify the resource models\n• Tight coupling with tenants\nrequires a lot of tenant shared knowledge\n• Difficult to implement and hard to change.\nIn terms of evolution, we can progress from manual operations to automated operations and ultimately\nautonomous operations.\n© TM Forum 2021.

Page 15 of 16\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nFigure 1-3 From Automated to Autonomous Operations\nManual operations:\nInput: Documents and work orders\n• A team of specialists operates the network manually by configuring, provisioning, assuring,\noptimizing …\n• All decisions are made, and all actions are initiated by humans.\nAutomated operations: where we automate those manual tasks\nInput: SLA/SLS/SLO, policies, TOSCA models, etc.\n• Workflows and policies invoking actions through dedicated API\n• Tight coupling between services and policies\n• ‘Zero-touch’ experience only as long as policies match situations\n• Intelligence and decision-making by humans at design-time.\nAutonomous operations:\nInput: Intent for setting goals and targets\n• A paradigm shift from the explicit invocation of actions to goals-based autonomy\n• AI can explore and find new solutions\n• Zero-touch because the machine can assess utility, consequences, risk, etc.\nThe benefits of the Autonomous Networks approach include:\n• Agility through intent and the consistency imposed by closed control loop mechanisms\n• Support Self-X management capabilities\n• The basis for strategic and comprehensive use of AI.\n1.5 Technical Requirements\nThe evolution of network operations needs to support the following four technical requirements:\n• Autonomous Domain\nAutonomous Networks move away from the rigid network integration models of the past where\nare the internal details of a network realization are exposed to the tenant /consumer. Those\nmodels prevent and inhibit Self X business capabilities by creating a high level of coupling between\nthe tenant/consumer view and the implementation. Autonomous domains are the key concept for\nenabling agility through the separation of concerns- especially the ‘what’ from the ‘how’ - in\nestablishing and evolving Autonomous Network systems and for allowing their supervision by CSP\nOperations.\n• Intent-driven Interfaces\nIn contrast to the very-detailed traditional resource model APIs, Intent-driven APIs focus on\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 16 of 17\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\ndescribing the ‘what’ – the ‘what’ being the expectations , the desired outcome from an\nAutonomous Domain – rather than exposing details of ‘how’ to configure the resources within an\nAN Domain. Intent-driven service interfaces for the tenant consumer are an essential prerequisite\nfor enabling Autonomous Domains supporting self X capabilities.\n• Self-X Capabilities and Closed control Loop Optimization\nClosed control loops are an essential part of an Autonomous domain optimization of the tenant\nservice. Multiple control loops may be used to optimize over different timescales (e.g., NGMN\nrequirements of fast and slow control loop). However, the goals for these closed controls are not\njust set by the Tenant Consumer Intent-driven Service but also by the CSP. The CSP sets goals for\naggregate Autonomous domain tenant service operational behavior– for example, resource usage\noptimization and optimization of the trade-off between individual tenant service types and\ninstances.\n• Decoupled Operational layers supporting Operational Flexibility\nCurrent APIs provide very specific information on the type of service required. Due to this, the\nService Provider has to either render a service meeting exact requirements ( even if it means\ninefficient leverage of resource pool ) or reject the service (even though the service requestor\nmight have found slightly impaired service acceptable ) or provide the best-effort service ( the\nservice requestor may not find the service acceptable ). For communication services to be\nleveraged for mission/business-critical services, the services must be rendered cost-effectively. The\nrequestor can express tolerance boundaries in different dimensions and the Service Provider can\nunambiguously understand and run the service within those boundaries.\n1.6 Key Concepts\nFigure 1-4 Key Autonomous Network Concepts shows that the Autonomous Domain is the central concept\nfor Autonomous Networks. The Autonomous Domain concepts support the technical evolution from\ntraditional Network management approaches to AI-enabled Autonomous Networks.\nFigure 1-4 Key Autonomous Network Concepts\nTwo key actors are closely involved in the interaction with Autonomous Networks:\n• The Tenant Customer: sets the goal for the autonomous network. The goal describes the tenant\ncustomer requirements including their SLA requirements.\n• The CSP Operation Supervisor: Operations is responsible for the control and supervision of the\naggregate behavior of the AD Business Services across all tenants, set operational objectives such as\nresource usage optimization and tenant service requirements via intent-driven service. The CSP\nOperations Supervisor sets the level of autonomy.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 17 of 18\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nThe intentions of these two actors are not the same due to different knowledge and responsibility and\nconflicts may arise that become more severe as the actual service rendering services become constrained.\nThe Control Loop should have the capability to detect these conflicts and the ability to resolve conflicts. In\ncases where the conflict cannot be resolved, it is necessary to notify the relevant actors for further human\nintervention (i.e., escalation).\nAutonomous Domains may be composed of one or more closed loops, also bind the closed control loops\nused to realize the Intent-driven service to the supporting resources according to defined supervision and\ncontrol objectives. The control loop can be used across multiple domains, a bigger Autonomous Domains\ncan be constructed by aggregating multiple smaller autonomous domains together. These and other\nconcepts are described later in this document. A metamodel (using UML notation) for all the concepts\nprovides a formal unpinning of how Autonomous Domains are defined, linked, and automated (see\nappendix).\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 18 of 19\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\n2 Autonomy Concepts and Principles\n2.1 Automatic, Autonomic, Autonomous\nThe following section outlines the concepts and principles of what mean by the term Autonomy and having\nautonomy (i.e., autonomous). We explore the dynamic and dialogue between the Human (arguably still the\nmost important part of the Autonomous Network) and the Machine (the AN). We examine the interaction\nbetween Machines and the Humans who trust them, delegate to them, and in the case of semi-\nautonomous networks, the humans who operate them. In the Readers Guide, we provided a short\ndefinition of some of the key terminology. To recap, we revisit these definitions in the table below.\nTable 3 The 4 A's\nAutonomy The capability to make decisions free from human control.\nAutomatic Able to operate independently of human control\nAutonomous Having autonomy.\nAutonomic Acting or occurring involuntarily. To respond without thinking.\nAutomatic means working by itself with little or no direct human control. An automatic task is not\nmanually performed as no humans are involved.\nAutonomic means acting involuntarily or unconsciously; like a humans’ autonomic nervous\nsystem. Therefore, an autonomic function is one performed \"without thinking\", no cognition, or no policy\ninvolved.\nAutonomous means having the freedom to act independently. Having the freedom to govern itself or\ncontrol its own affairs.\nA simple way to distinguish between \"autonomous\" and \"automated\" is to examine the amount of\nadaptation, learning, and decision-making that is integrated into the system. Automated systems typically\nrun within a well-defined set of parameters and are very restricted in what tasks they can perform. The\ndecisions made or actions taken by an automated system are based on predefined heuristics.\nNetworks will evolve from simple automation to autonomic control and ultimately to autonomous\nbehavior. The sophistication of self-management capability will also increase as these autonomy level\nincreases, such as a progression from self-healing to self-optimization and then to self-governing abilities.\nOverall, the capabilities will evolve from “doing”, to “responding” and “deciding”. It is only in the decision-\nmaking cycle that the learning processes can be applied because it analyzes decisions taken and measure\ntheir effectiveness over time.\n2.2 Principles of Human-Machine Interaction\nIf Automation in networks is about doing, then Autonomous Networks are about learning-by-doing. But\nwho is doing the teaching? In autonomous systems up to Level 4, the teaching is performed by expert\nhuman operators. The systems are also learning by themselves, or self-learning based on experiential data.\nFor example, machine learning on data will augment the current automation systems to enable capabilities\nsuch as self-healing, etc., but it is the human intelligence and human knowledge that effectively ‘teaches’\nthe AN. This balance of self-learning versus directed learning at hints the new duality of humans and\nmachines in networks of the future. The following section explores Human-Machine interactions, the roles,\nand the delicate balance they must strike to enable trustworthy yet independent and autonomous systems.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 20\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nAutonomy is a Continuum\nFigure 2-1 Slider of Autonomy\nThe concept of “sliding autonomy” or adjustable autonomy attempts to dynamically merge the good\nqualities of both humans and machines (robots) into a single system (AN) [Brookshire]. Figure 2-1 illustrates\nthe so-called “slider” of autonomy where control and decision-making within the autonomous system are\ndecided by adjusting an overall level of autonomy.\nIndividual components of the autonomous network may operate at discrete levels of autonomy (Figure 2-2)\nand these levels form the basis for determining how mature are the autonomic capabilities of the\nautonomous network (more on levels in section AN Levels )\nFigure 2-2 Slider Control sets the Autonomy Level (0-5)\nHumans are part of AN\nIf we consider that achieving Level 5 Autonomy is quite some time away and that for regulatory reasons\nalone it may well be expedient to keep at least some humans involved. Network operations people need\nnot worry about automating themselves out of the picture. Their roles will change significantly, and the\nskillsets needed will transform in a short space of time. Mundane automation work will be handed off to\nautonomous systems, but the business side will always need people to oversee the network and design and\nmonitor the new generation of autonomous systems. AN will still require people who understand how the\nnetwork works to teach or train the artificial intelligence itself while providing oversight and algorithmic\ntweaking. In reality, humans need to stay ‘in the loop’ as automated systems take on more intelligent tasks.\nMachines may not be trained to handle all unexpected situations; humans need to remain in the control\nloop to take care of such situations. The machine will learn and improve its knowledge over time, and one\nday may become self-sufficient in some areas.\nHumans and Machines are Agents\nA human agent has eyes, ears, and other organs that act as sensors with hands, legs, mouth, and other\nbody parts acting as actuators.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 20 of 21\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nFigure 2-3 Humans and Machines are Agents\nLikewise, a Machine agent such as those used in Autonomous networks use virtual and physical sensors\nand actuators, and this equivalence of humans and machines sensing and effecting their environment is\nimportant for us to understand how both can work together to achieve outcomes.\nFigure 2-4 Intelligent Agents\nThe operator defines business intent as the only input to the intelligent system that implements the\nintelligent agent (see Figure 2-4).\n• Business intent can change very frequently: for example, a dynamic SLA.\nThe environment is delivering data about its state, and it is changed by actions.\n• The environment is dynamically changing by a huge number of factors.\nThe Zero-touch intelligent control system, or Agent:\n• Perceives the environment\n• Has knowledge about the intent\n• Has knowledge about the world and the relationships and processes within\n• Is capable of thinking: Reason, Plan, Evaluate, Predict, …\n• Dispatches actions towards the environment\nHuman delegates Responsibility to Machine but not Accountability\nThe use case diagram (Figure 2-5) illustrates the relationship between Humans and Machines in terms of\nsharing the overall task burden if not the entire responsibility for the role. The human delegates the task\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 21 of 22\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nexecution to the machine. The machine may use AI/ML to assist in its execution; it may even have cognition\nof the task at hand, but ultimately the responsibility lies with the human. The principal-agent 4 problem\nrecognizes that responsibility, when given to a machine, lies with the delegator, in this case, the human\neven though the \"Task\" is performed by the machine. Hence, humans delegate tasks to machines but not\nresponsibility. Accountability is a different but related concept and is now closely tied to the concept of\ngovernance. Put more simply, accountability is about the ability to report on or explain your actions. As\nsuch, accountability happens after the task is executed.\nFigure 2-5 Human delegates Responsibility to Machine but not Accountability\nMachine is a Party, Decision Maker is a PartyRole\nThe class diagram illustrates how we can use the existing TM Forum Information Framework (SID) concepts\nand patterns of Party and PartyRole to model Humans and Machines [SID]. It serves also to disambiguate\nthe roles that a human and machine may perform. What is important to note is that the roles performed\nremain the same regardless of whether a human or machine performs them.\nFigure 2-6 Machine is a Party, Decision Maker is a PartyRole\n4 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal-agent_problem\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 22 of 23\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\n2.3 Architectural Principles\nFuture Mode of Network Operations is Human-Machine Collaboration\nAs AI continues to mature and play an increasingly important role in operations, network operations\nmanagement will be shifting from the traditional \"person + process\" model to the new \"Human + Machine\"\nCollaboration Model.\nIn the \"Human + Machine\" Collaboration Model, machines assist operations by applying AI and machine\nlearning (ML) algorithms to large data sets collected by operations support tools and business systems and\nsimulating human thought processes and behavior, such as risk perception, pattern recognition, data\nanalysis and interpretation, complex decision-making, and execution of elaborated tasks. The \"Human +\nMachine\" Collaboration Model provides operations management with AI and ML capabilities that free\noperational personnel from repetitive and routine tasks that machines can do even better than humans.\nUnder the new operating model, new technologies will greatly empower the traditional operations teams.\nThe human's unique experience and judgment skills are being transformed into data and then injected into\nthe knowledge base. The machine learning ability will form the closed loop of the networks' self-decision\nand self-execution capabilities. As a result, the convergence of human insight and machine learning will\noffer unlimited possibilities for network operations. Below, the figure shows how the role of person and\nmachine is evolving through different development stages of the intelligent operations system\ntransformation.\nAutonomous Networks are composed of platforms with different Autonomy Levels\nThe earliest developed Autonomous Networks will be assembled from platforms with varying degrees or\nlevels of autonomy support. Many Autonomous Domains may be Level 3 for example, while others may\nachieve Level 4 and only require some basic human supervision. Some operational platforms will control\nservice lifecycles at Level 3 while other services may be needed to achieve Level 3 due to the need for\n“human-in-the-loop” processes for that particular service.\nAs such, the dissonance or “friction” generated by the disparity of autonomy levels is a significant challenge\nto overcome for the viability of Autonomous Networks. Does a drop-off in autonomy level in one platform\ncause the overall autonomy level of an Autonomous Domain to degrade to the lowest common\ndenominator? These autonomy level and their evaluations are discussed in more detail in Section 4.\nTrust and Explainability\nTrust is established between a Human and a Machine. Trust, therefore, exists between the Trustor and the\nTrustee. Trust can be achieved by providing consistency of results over a long period (See [IG1229] –for\nmore on Trust principles). If Autonomous Networks depend on trust, then explainable AI applications in\ntelecom networks become very desirable and even necessary. Currently, AI is mainly to assist decision-\nmaking, while configurations still need manual operation. For example, in an energy-saving scenario in the\ndata center, AI reasoning output to shut down a hundred servers, the operator needs to know: are there\nany critical applications running on the hundred servers? What factors lead to the result of this reasoning?\nWhat are the consequences of performing this operation? The reasoning process of the existing AI\nalgorithm is black-box, which cannot gain sufficient trust in the result.\nSecondly, in the future, systems can take action without manual confirmation. But we will still need to\nknow the reason for the action. For example, why did the system shut down particular devices? To do a\nreview or especially an audit, we also need to know the evidence for the decision. There are three main\napproaches in the industry to solve this problem:\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 23 of 24\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\n1) Optimize the existing algorithms for explainability.\n2) Introduce new and explainable methods of AI learning and reasoning, such as Symbolic Learning.\n3) Adding the explainable modules in the original model to simulate the behavior.\nOne example of why telecom needs explainable AI is in the area of Network configuration where\nconfiguration changes need manual execution. The operators need to know the reason before they execute\nthe configuration change. In the future, an autonomous system can take action without manual\nconfirmation: e.g., if one access node does not work, the system can detect the failure and share the node\nservice to other nodes.\nSome of the main challenges around explainability include:\n1. The need for a valid interpretation study method: for example, how to effectively modify the\noriginal classifier and how to quickly obtain the interpretation data set.\n2. The need to create a transparent and understandable model instead of the original\nunexplainable model: By transparent, we mean an increased understanding of how AI was created\nand deployed. The scope of solutions is for further study but may include mask constraints, limit\nthe complexity of the classifier, modify the classifier structure to have both the depth of learning\nand the intelligibility of the decision tree.\n3. Behavior Simulation: Adding the explainable modules in the original model to simulate the\nbehavior, to achieve explainability.\nAI Safety\nFor AI to be broadly adopted into an autonomous network it must be safe. “Safe AI” or “AI safety” can be\ndefined as the way in which AI is deployed and used so as to not harm humanity, be fair and equitable to\nall, without bias, and generally be a positive influence on consumers and businesses alike. While\nbusinesses and algorithm designers may set out with those principles in mind, the optimizing nature of AI\nalgorithms can have unintended consequences.

Thus, it is impossible to precisely\nknow how they will behave when deployed, which presents numerous safety concerns:\n1 Unsafe exploration: the agent performs potentially dangerous actions in trial-and-error\nsearches for optimal behavior.\n2 Reward hacking: the agent exploits unintended optima of a naively specified reward function.\n3 Negative side effects: to achieve a specified goal optimally, the agent causes other undesirable\noutcomes.\n4 Unsafe interrupt: the agent learns to avoid human interruptions that interfere with the\nmaximization of specified rewards.\n5 Absent supervisor: the agent learns to alter behavior according to the presence or absence of a\nsupervisor that controls rewards. This issue has become quite prevalent in the chatbot space\nand is the reason many companies currently disable their chatbots outside core business hours.\n• Human-controlled, benign intent\nExamples in this category include supervised algorithms, such as classifiers, that are trained at a\npoint in time, and then deployed to generate business value (decision making, action-taking, etc.).\nDespite the best intentions of the engineers involved in creating the algorithm AI safety concerns\nmay still arise. It may perform very well on datasets used in the production process, but still may\nnot be fit for purpose for the following reasons:\n1 Lack of robustness: despite performing well on test data, algorithms may perform very\ndifferently on other data.\n2 Bias: well-trained robust algorithms can still reflect biases that exist in the training data or\nbiases that arise in feature selection.\n3 Privacy handling: if the deployment of an algorithm exposes information about members of\nthe training set, sensitive information can be gathered directly from the model even without\nthe release of training data.\n4 Explainability: easily interpretable AI algorithms are key, lack of explainability means\nalgorithms can’t be rationalized or audited.\n• Human-controlled, malicious intent\nSimilar to the cybersecurity space, there will, of course, be malicious usage of AI that needs assessment and\ncounter-strategies. Defensive solutions to these problems are likely to be both technical and policy-based.\nSecurity by design\nThe cybersecurity industry follows a predictable pattern: attackers find a way to penetrate a security\nsystem that was once heralded as impenetrable. The security breach is eventually discovered, the\nvulnerability is addressed, and attackers subsequently look to find a new way in. This pattern is unlikely to\nchange with the only possible change being that the cycle times will continue to be reduced. With this in\nmind, from an autonomous network security standpoint, the goal is not to make it impossible for criminals\nto access critical information, as this is a task that cannot be accomplished with any degree of certainty.\nRather, a more pragmatic and achievable target is:\nThe autonomous network should make the cost of illegally accessing sensitive\ninformation much higher than the value of the information to the attackers.\nSecurity assessment and enforcement has, over time, shifted from a predominantly manual activity into\ndynamic risk management activity, where continuous situational security awareness is complemented with\nproactive and reactive capabilities. This requires new models, systems and methods capable of capturing\nand measuring:\n• dynamic models of the state of IT and networking systems\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 25 of 26\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\n• threat intelligence information that is continuously gathered from both internal and external\nsources\n• business objectives, or intent (which could be driven by customers, partners, industry regulators,\ncompetitive forces, or other)\nThe combined use of endpoint, perimeter, and network-based security is required to protect the data and\napplications of a network. An end-to-end solution is required, and a variety of functions (and supporting\ntechnology) are needed, a high-level depiction for which is provided in Figure 2-8. From an autonomy\nperspective, end-to-end security should be an autonomous domain (described in section 3.3).\nFigure 2-8 Security infrastructure for autonomous network\nThe following functions represent the key functional blocks for end-to-end security within an autonomous\nnetwork architecture:\nEndpoint monitoring – this will be deployed on all devices with sufficient embedded intelligence, from cars,\nelectric vehicle charging units, parking meters to door locks, vacuum cleaners, and washing machines.\nCloud application monitoring – all applications running in the cloud will be monitored for security\npurposes.\nPermission-based access control – over time biometric authentication will be used to improve the\nauthentication of users.\nSecurity proxies with payload traffic analytic capabilities – The increased use of end-to-end encryption is\nan attempt to protect the privacy of user data in transit between two points. While effective this makes it\nvery difficult for security tools to effectively monitor networks for evidence of infiltration or, for example,\ncompromised devices. This creates an ironic contradiction: the mechanisms consumers and enterprises are\nusing to protect data and privacy are putting information at greater risk. Thus, security proxies must\nsupport protocols offering flexible levels of encryption to enable visibility into some payload traffic, for QoS\npurposes, as well as security and law enforcement.\nSecurity analytics — security analytics must be deployed on a scale capable of capturing and storing\nvirtually all network activity among all devices, including IoT devices. This will enable both real-time threat\ndetection and mitigation, as well as forensic analysis. Such analytics will typically be deployed as virtualized\nfunctions in enterprise data centers, as well as in central and local edge clouds.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved.

They provide real-time analysis of security alerts\ngenerated by applications and network functions. Many of the products5 on the marketplace today have\nevolved into security autonomic platforms that rapidly activate or modify security policies automatically\nbased on the perceived threat.\nSDN (Software-defined networking) — SDN is a key network technology that provides dynamic flexibility to\nallow the network to rapidly and automatically adapt to security threats. The combination of SDN and\nSIEMs together with security analytics will result in the overall orchestration of cybersecurity defense.\nEcosystem support for threat intelligence and security expertise — This will involve network and cloud\nservice providers and enterprises working closely with government and international agencies to ensure\nthe protection of data and the infrastructure that depends on it.

The holistic method to reduce\ncomplexity is decomposing the network into multiple self-governing domains that only interact with other\nlayers/domains/users via intent-driven interfaces (API or Human interaction). The self-governance or\nautonomy of the domains is achieved via carefully coordinated (orchestrated) closed loops and intelligence\ntakes an important role to enable parts or even entire processes of the closed loop via intent.\nFigure 3-1 Building Blocks of Framework\nThe goal of the AN Technical Architecture is to define a minimal set of technical concepts and principles to\nrealize the requirements described in the Autonomous Networks Framework summarized below.\nThe idea is to define and realize Autonomous Domains that are self-contained, self-managing, self-\noptimizing, and self-healing, operating with autonomous capabilities and capable of implementation using\ndifferent internal technologies. One key requirement is to have Autonomous Domains and control loops\noperating across different scopes and different business functions. Figure 3-2 TM Forum Autonomous\nNetwork Framework shows a framework of composable domains that span ecosystems, customers,\nproducts, services, and resources –comprising networks computing and software.\nEnablement of these solutions permits more advanced arrangements of interacting Autonomous Domains\nto be constructed from simple Autonomous Domains each following a standardized integration pattern\ndescribed in 5.2.1. This requires the AN Technical Architecture model to be simple, self-similar at multiple\nlevels of granularity and scope, and capable of composition into more complex arrangements. A precise\ndefinition of these concepts is needed in a formal metamodel to capture configurations of these concepts\nin a machine-readable and “processable” format suitable for automated design, configuration, and\ndeployment.\nAt the heart of AN is the idea of intelligent software that continuously make decisions about what to do\nnext while operating in a dynamic, heterogeneous network environment. Such decisions are taken\nautonomously, or with some degree (or formally ‘Level’) of autonomy, that depends on the influence\n/feedback (also termed ‘experience’) from human operators or other software systems (both traditional\nand autonomous).\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 28 of 29\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nFigure 3-2 TM Forum Autonomous Network Framework\nThe AN framework positions the intelligent systems across all 3 operational layers and encapsulates\ndecision-making using closed control loops within Autonomous Domains (Principles of Autonomy,\nModularity) and also collaborative (or federative) autonomy using cross-layer control loops using intent-\ndriven interfaces and intelligence and knowledge based interfaces. This chapter of the technical\narchitecture will describe the operational layers and the concept of autonomous domain and explore some\nintegration patterns. Subsequent chapters will explore the concepts of Levels, Domains, Intent and Control\nloops, etc., in greater detail.\n3.2 Core Concepts\nThe four fundamental concepts introduced in this AN Technical Architecture to support the AN objectives\nare:\n• Autonomous Domains.\n• Objects (or Managed Entities) and their taxonomy.\n• Business Services that are exposed by Autonomous Domains are based on the notion of Intent-driven\nService definitions. Business Services exposed by one domain may also satisfy dependencies from other\nAutonomous Domains. Autonomous domains may expose different Business Services to different\nactors including Tenant/ consumer and Operations Supervisory roles. Each Business Service may have a\ndifferent lifecycle for the information (Knowledge Objects) that they expose.\n• Support of (closed) Control Loops within Autonomous Domains and across Autonomous Domains.\nTogether these deceptively simple formally defined concepts when implemented allow sets of\ninterconnected Autonomous Domains to exhibit controlled, dynamic and responsive behavior at a scale\nand velocity not achievable using traditional systems' management concepts. These agile characteristics are\nessential for the operational management of the coming generation of applications, services, and\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 29 of 30\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nmanagement based on virtualization and cloud-based Communication Services and Networks.\nThis is the communications industry equivalent to the aerospace 'fly-by-wire' challenge. The adaptive\nbehavior of Autonomous Domains can be supervised and controlled through formally defined delegated\nresponsibilities operating to policies authorized by other Autonomous Domains.\nAutonomous Network\nThe AN Business Requirements guide [IG1218] describes what we expect an Autonomous Network should\nprovide:\n• Provide a Zero-X experience to end-users (zero-wait, zero-touch, zero-trouble, zero-trust, zero-\nfriction)\n• Supports Self-X management capabilities that enable the Zero-X experience\n• And comprise of simplified network architecture, virtualized components, intelligent agents and\ndecision engines to automate business/network operations.\nThis leads us to a more functional definition as follows. An Autonomous Network is\nA set of network and software platforms that are capable of sensing its environment\nand adapting its behavior accordingly with little or no human input\nFigure 3-3 AN can sense and adapt to its environment\nFigure 3-3, above illustrates the closed loop nature of this definition. After the AN senses the environment\nit can anticipate its next action and it can learn from its previous taken decisions. This is how the AN\nbecomes adaptive rather than autonomic or reactive. Autonomous networks are self-governing systems\nthat can configure, heal, and optimize themselves and are capable of making decisions with little or no\nhuman direction or supervision. They can adapt to their environment, optimizing and personalizing the\nend-user experience of the services they provide. Autonomous Networks result in networks that cost less\nto operate, with overall improved agility, security, and resiliency. It is a system that can measure, analyze,\nand control itself continuously and efficiently, driven by business objectives. These business objectives are\nspecified using SLA and Intent and underpinned with trust. Put even more simply, an autonomous network\nis one that can measure, analyze, and control itself continuously6.\nAn Autonomous Network\n• has the freedom to act independently, govern itself, and control its behavior with no external humans\nor machine acting upon it.\n• consists of a simplified network architecture, virtualized components, automating agents, intelligent\ndecision engines.\n• presents composable capabilities to create intelligent business and network operations.\n• can self-configure, monitor, correct (self-repair), defend and analyze, resulting in a network that costs\nless to operate, while increasing agility, security, and resiliency.\n6 This paraphrases work from Kelleher et al in “Empowering Self-Driving Networks” [KELL]\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 30 of 31\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\n3GPP defines an Autonomous Network as a “telecommunication system (including management system\nand network) with autonomy capabilities which is able to be governed by itself with minimal to no human\nintervention”. Given that definition, how do we build such a network and how do we deploy them? The\nfollowing sections will describe some of the main building blocks required.\n3.3 Autonomous Domain\nThis concept defines the scope of autonomous behavior delegated by an organization and is the basic\nbuilding block of AN Technical Architecture. An Autonomous Domain is defined as:\nAn administrative governance boundary (Management Domain) that defines the scope of delegated\nautonomous behaviors.\nIt exposes a set of Business Services based on the capabilities of a set of objects over which the AD\nexercises governance ( policy, rules, patterns including closed control loops), Is self-managing self-scaling\nand manages its own lifecycle and publishes its Service Capabilities and Business Services in a Catalog /\nRepository.\nObjects can include Intent Services, management interfaces, (sub) Domain managers, Control loops,\ncontrollers, orchestrators, decision-makers, AI analytics, monitors, policies, etc.\nOperational Layers are decoupled (Business, Service, Resource)\nThe AN framework uses a layered architecture pattern, where the architecture is stratified into three layers\n- a business operations layer, a service operations layer, and a resource operations layer. Each layer runs in\nself-operating mode and hides the details of domain implementation, operations, and the functions within\nthe domain to the consumer.\nA prerequisite of an autonomous architecture is the efficient separation of the “operating regions” for the\ncontrol loops. This can be achieved by decoupling control systems and autonomous platforms into these\nAutonomous Domains thereby ensuring that they control “different independent outputs based on\nindependent inputs”, as defined in ETSI GANA.\nBusiness Services\nGB986 -CP Frameworks Metamodel has the formal definition of Business Service as :\nA Business Service exposes the functionality of Business Roles or Collaborations to their environment.\nThis functionality is accessed through one or more Business Interfaces. It may access Business Objects.\nA Business Service is defined as the externally visible (\"logical\") functionality, which is meaningful to the\nenvironment and is realized by business behavior (Business Process, Business Function, or Business\nInteraction).\nA Business Service exposes the functionality of Business Roles or Collaborations to their environment.\nThis functionality is accessed through one or more business interfaces. A Business Service is realized by\none or more Business Processes, Business Functions, or Business Interactions that are performed by the\nBusiness Roles or Business Collaborations, respectively.\nThe name of a Business Service should preferably be a verb ending with \"-ing\"; e.g., \"transaction\nprocessing\". Also, a name containing the word \"service\" may be used.\nThis definition is preferred as it is supported by a precise definition of relationships with other Integration\nFramework concepts in particular those associated with multiple prior interface definitions: MTNM MTOSI\nMTOP OSS/J and can be used as Integration metamodel for open APIs and 3GPP IRP and other SDO\nmanagement interfaces.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 31 of 32\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nA Business Service is a service that is delivered to business customers by business units. For example,\ndelivery of financial services to customers of a bank, or goods to the customers of a retail store. Successful\ndelivery of business services often depends on one or more IT services. A business service may consist almost\nentirely of an IT service – for example, an online banking service or an external website where product\norders can be placed by business customers.\nTOGAF Business Service: Represents a service provided by the business, which may then be realized by\none or more IS services.\nCategories of Business Services\nAn Autonomous Domain may expose services of different types in part depending on which parts of the AN\nBusiness Architecture are being defined and realized.\nFigure 3-4 Autonomous Domain Business Service Categories\nThe categories that have been identified are based on different roles consuming those service and include:\n• Management Business Service (Operational processes focused on tenant instances) used by systems\nproviding tenant instances of services ultimately to end consumers (retail and enterprise).\n• AN Supervision & Control Business Services (lifecycle, AI, and administration) used by SP planners and\ndeveloper roles.\nFor Autonomous Domains representing communication network resources additional business services are\nneeded:\n• Network Transport Business Service (Control Plane) to control plane application user roles.\n• Network Transport Business Service (User/Data plane) to end-user application roles.\nAI-Enabled\nAI is evolving from perceptual intelligence to cognitive intelligence. In the next 10 years, technologies such\nas neural networks, knowledge graphs, and domain migration will make it possible to achieve system\nautonomy in telecom networks. Combining AI with other technologies can significantly improve O&M\nefficiency. It can replace manual operations that were once required to solve large numbers of repeated\nand complex computing tasks in the telecom field. It can also improve telecom network prevention and\nforecast capabilities based on big data volumes.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 32 of 33\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nWhile the training platform usually requires tremendous computing power, it is suitable to be deployed\ncentralized in the cloud or local cloud infrastructure, then open the data channel with each AI-enabled\nmanagement system.\nWhile the inference works in a nearly online manner, it utilized the AI model rendered from the training\nplatform, dealing with the inputted real-time data, giving analysis results in a short time, the result usually\nsupporting decisions or provide a guide for further processes. Considering this online characteristic of the\ninference, they are normally deployed in application layers.\nNowadays, all operation/business supporting systems are all evolving to intelligence by using knowledge\nand inference in their own domains, even in the NE layer, in order to offload the huge data exchange\nefforts also enabling to have necessary analysis abilities, on the one hand, NE consuming local data to get\nconclusions, on the other hand, expecting offering less size but more valuable data to upper\nmanaging/controlling layer.\nThen in the future networks, the AI capabilities will be deployed in layers:\n• the cloud layer: training platform and knowledge center, providing model training service, and\ndigitalized knowledge.\n• the operation and management layer: model and inference application in specific domains.\n• NE layers leverage built-in AI capabilities provided by devices.\n3.4 AN Technical Architecture Diagram\nFigure 3-5 AN Technical Architecture\n• The key technologies enabling the AN transformation are: intent-driven interfaces/closed loop\nautomation/Intelligence-driven decision making (AI/ML/Knowledge).\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 33 of 34\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\n• The holistic method to reduce complexity is decomposing the network into multiple self-governing\ndomains that only interact with other layers/domains/users via intent-driven interfaces (API or\nHuman interaction).\n• The self-governance or autonomy of the domains is achieved via carefully coordinated\n(orchestrated) closed loops and Intelligence plays an important role to enable parts or even whole\nflows of the closed loop.\nAI-enabled\nAI technology is used in many different platforms and systems, and different deployment scenarios. AI\nservices are provided to support these systems including AI training, data lakes, network and service\nknowledge base, and an AI application market.\nService Operations\nBased on the E2E process of planning, construction, maintenance, and optimization, and three major\ncapabilities of service collaboration, assurance, and analysis, achieve cross-vendor and cross-domain\nservice-layer autonomy and control loop management.\nResource Operations\nBased on network management, control, and analysis capabilities, automatically translates upper-layer\nservices and application intents into network behaviors, continuously ensures the SLA commitment of\nnetwork connections or functions and implements autonomous control loop management of single-domain\nnetworks.\n3.5 Patterns for AN to AN system Integration\nFigure 3-6 Intent interactions between 2 AN systems (domains or platforms)\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 34 of 35\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\n3.6 Patterns for AN to Non-AN System Integration\nWhen discussing Intent-driven Networking (IBN) and Autonomous Network (AN) Systems we need to keep\nin mind the fact that not all systems within a Communication Service Provider’s (CSP) stack will be swapped\nout and replaced with IBN supporting AN systems at the same time. There are likely to be transition periods\nwhere certain network, OSS or BSS systems don’t support integration with ANs using Intent-driven\ninterfaces.\nFigure 3-7 Adapter to Intent Integration Pattern\nTo support this transition period, mechanisms are required that allow AN systems to interoperate with\nnon-AN systems. Since it may be difficult or undesirable to modify non-AN systems (especially legacy\nsystems) the AN system will need to be modified to support integration. This is in line with approaches\nused in other areas where interoperability between systems having different capabilities is a major\nchallenge (e.g., ETSI ENI’s “assisted” system approach [ENI005]).\nTo address this challenge, integration with non-AN systems requires special adapters to be provided in the\nAN system that can handle API requests from legacy systems. This includes both synchronous and\nasynchronous request patterns.\nThis approach is shown in Figure 3-7 with the following major components:\n• Legacy (non-AN) systems (Systems A and B) with potentially different integration APIs\n• Integration Adapters within AN System (proposed one per non-AN system API)\n• Intent Handler: A component that handles incoming intents and triggers actions (API calls) and\nintent calls to other AN systems (System C and D).\nIntegration Adapters\nThe integration adapter is a critical component in the integration. We would need to examine each non-AN\nAPI integration point to derive specific requirements for the integration adapter. This is why we propose a\none-to-one mapping between the non-AN system and the integration adapter. There may be common\naspects of standardized APIs that could allow adapter reuse, but it may also be simpler to start with a\ndisaggregated approach.\nMapping of requests to intents requires:\n• Ability to maintain request state which is synced with intent-driven state\n• Ability to map requests to pre-created intents\n• Ability to generate intents based on requests – a more difficult task but may be required for certain\ncases\n• Generating a suitable response to non-AN requests from intent-driven internal state\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 35 of 36\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nA point requiring further investigation is whether the adapters can call out to non-AN systems (i.e., request\noriginates in the AN system but uses an adapter instead of an Action generated by the Intent Handler). To\navoid overburdening the adapter function and to streamline flows all outbound requests from the AN\nsystem should pass through the Intent Handler unless we find use cases where that cannot be supported.\nIntegration Adapters and the Slider of Automation\nThe “slider” of automation that can be used to manage the AN system will also impact the operation of the\nadapters. For example, during a planned outage (maintenance/upgrade scenario) we may wish to isolate\nnon-AN systems that are not impacted to ensure their normal operation.\nA topic for further investigation is how the adapters and Intent Handlers could impact the AN system as a\nwhole. This requires some form of monitoring around the adapters (incoming relative to AN system).\nSimilarly, monitoring is required around the Actions issued by the Intent Handler (outgoing relative to AN\nsystem). This is required to ensure the AN system autonomously disconnects from non-AN systems when it\ncannot reliably participate in the integration. There could be issues arising from degradation in the non-AN\nsystem (e.g., incoming requests are incorrect or outgoing Actions are correct but fail at a high rate) or in the\nAN system (e.g., incoming requests are valid but not processed correctly or outgoing Actions badly formed).\n3.7 AN Architecture Model\nOne of the key challenges in autonomic management is the alignment of concepts and models across the\nindustry. We need the right domain models to support these new concepts. A unified model for the entities\nis significant for integration efforts and APIs that are going to be generated in this area. The SID part of TM\nForum’s Frameworx is used as the foundation information model and is enhanced to support the\nAutonomous Management needs. As the concepts and business entities used within autonomy stretch\nbeyond the remit of SID, the concept of a “metamodel” is being used. The metamodel is composed of a set\nof individual domain models that are used for specific areas and a top-level set of relationships among\nthem can be looked at. Figure 3-8 shows the top-level entities that we believe are necessary for\nautonomous self-management. Some of them are well-established data models that the\ntelecommunication industry is using for many years while others include new and evolving data entities\nthat should take their place in the metamodel.\n© TM Forum 2021.

In recent years, several\nSDOs have looked at the modeling of Domains and Platforms. In other contexts, such as knowledge and\ncognitive automation, new models and patterns are needed. Each of the entities in the figure point to a\nspecifically required information model. The abstract classes of a “Cognitive Concept” that includes Intent\nmanagement and the “Pattern” that include the Control loop, mean that some more entities may be\ndeveloped under these areas. The metamodel provides an overview different managed entities to form a\ncomplete holistic model needed for autonomous management. In general, the key data entities represent\ndifferent areas of responsibility:\n• The different types of business-related managed entities: Products, Services, and Resources are the\nsubjects of management.\n• The Intent concept is categorized under more abstract concepts such as cognition.\n• The Patterns provide the new mechanisms that support the AN management, such as the control\nloop.\n• Domains provide boundaries and areas of responsibilities of the different management roles, either\nhuman-based or machine-based\n• Platforms are the systems that fulfill the different management roles.\nThe main relationships among these data models are described in the diagram below.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 37 of 38\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nFigure 3-9 Key Entities in model\nPlease note that the abstract classes and the lower level entities were taken out of the diagram for\nreadability. Additionally, some of the relationships that are described here represent multiple lower-level\nrelationships w elaborated. The notation “N: N *” is used to annotate that such an elaboration at a lower\nlevel exists. At this level, we can observe the key relationships:\n• The Business data entities: Product, Service, Resource may be “Subject of Intent”. At the lower level\ndata model, this means that each one of them may own a set of Intents, while a higher level Intent\nmay be applied on a set of such of these managed entities.\n• Intents drive the control loops. Again, this depends on the level of the Intent. A high-level Intent may\nbe translated to multiple control loops or a Control loop may be set with a specific Intent that it\ncontrols.\n• The Control loop operates on the main Business data entities: Product, Service, and Resource.\n• Now, going to boundaries and Domain Management, the Domain gets the responsibility on\nBusiness entities, such as: Products, Services and Resources.\n• The Domain may be responsible for some of the Control loops, while multi-domain control loops are\nalso possible, yet there is always a single Domain responsible for running a control loop, even if this\nis eventually delegated to multiple domains.\n• The Platforms are the actual systems that execute the management activities, they operate upon\nthe instructions and restrictions as provided by the Management Domains.\nIt is worth realizing that as described in the hierarchy view of the managed entities, most of these\nrelationships are translated to associations at the level of functions and Platform components that are the\nparts of the Domains and Platforms respectively. The second next level of the model is beyond the scope of\nthis current document and will be published in subsequent technical deliverables.\n3.8 AN Technical Architecture using other Reference Architectures\nTM Forum’s existing assets and best practices covering business operation, service operation, and resource\noperation will be updated as we progress our understanding of AN.\nSDOs with specific domain expertise are also studying on relevant areas of service/resource operations,\nespecially network lifecycle operations. It is better to find a way to harmonize these study efforts, and take\nthe advantages of each SDO, make sure the outputs could complement each other.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved.

Page 39 of 40\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\n4 AN Levels\n4.1 Levels of Autonomous Networks\nThe AN whitepaper proposed a harmonized classification system intending to provide a common\nunderstanding of network autonomy for autonomous networks. As such, this classification of levels builds a\nmaturity model7 to assess the level of automation achieved by an autonomous network:\n• Define the concept of autonomous networks\n• Identify six levels of network automation from “no automation” to “full automation”.\n• Base definitions and levels on functional aspects of technology.\n• Describe categorical distinctions for a stepwise progression through the levels.\n• Educate a wider community by clarifying for each level what role (if any) operators have in\nperforming the dynamic network operations task while a network automation system is engaged.\n4.2 Benefits of Levels\nIn the previous section, we described the levels and explained the categories used to determine levels. In\nthis section, we describe in greater detail how to leverage the 6 levels to perform assessments of autonomy\nsupport.\nSimilar to what the levels of driving automation means to the automotive industry [SAE J3016], a common\nunderstanding of the levels of the autonomous network would be helpful to the telecommunications\nindustry. The operator’s operational and management efforts and dedicated relevant resources will vary\naccording to different autonomous network levels. It would be beneficial for operators to have a clear view\non the expectation of the level of their network (s) to indicate the maturity of the network autonomy so that\nthey could first focus on the important features which should be prioritized to achieve a certain level of\nautonomy in their networks. This approach will also help operators to smoothly migrate to a higher\nautonomy level and attain better operational efficiency.\nAutonomous Network Levels have the following benefits:\n• Providing an evaluation basis for measuring the level of an autonomous network along with its\ncomponents and workflows.\n• Providing reference for gaps and priorities analysis for standardization works on network\nautonomy.\n• Providing guidance to operators, vendors and other participants of the telecommunications\nindustry for roadmap planning.\n7 Please refer to IG1252 Autonomous Network Levels Evaluation Methodology [IG1252] for a more comprehensive description of\nthe concepts, including Autonomous Networks Level methodology, operational processes, their underlying sub-processes and tasks\nand the evaluation approach for assessing an Autonomous Domain or Autonomous Network.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 40 of 41\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\n4.3 AN Level Classification\nAN Level\nTM Forum defines AN Levels as follows:\nAN Levels describe the level of autonomic capability in a given operational workflow or\nfor an autonomous domain (L0 to L5).\nAN Levels identify contextual autonomous capability.\nAN Levels describes how well autonomy capabilities have been applied in the network management\nworkflow. The participation of the human and systems in the network management workflow are important\nfactors to evaluate the network autonomy level. For each AN level, those tasks that can be performed by the\ntelecom system, those tasks to be performed by a human, and those tasks that are be performed by\ncooperation of human and telecom system needs to be clarified. As such, in the highest autonomy level, all\ntasks are performed by the system.\nAN Level Framework\nThe TM Forum AN Level Framework is used for evaluating the autonomous capability of the autonomous\nsystem or systems.\nTable 4 TM Forum AN Levels Framework\nL0: L1:\nL2: L3: L4: L5:\nAutonomous Manual Assisted\nPartial Conditional High Full\nLevels Operation & Operation & Autonomous Autonomous Autonomous Autonomou\nMaintenanc Maintenanc\nNetworks Networks Networks s Networks\ne e\nExecution P P/S S S S S\nAwareness P P/S P/S S S S\nAnalysis P P P/S P/S S S\nDecision P P P P/S S S\nIntent/Experience† P P P P P/S S\nApplicability N/A Selected Scenarios All Scenarios\nPeople (manual) Systems* (autonomous)\nP S\n* Note 1: Systems including management system, O&M tools and network.\n† Note 2: Intent/Experience is the group of tasks which translate intent from operator or customer into detailed\noperations which may affect one or more of the following groups of tasks (i.e., awareness, analysis, decision,\nexecution), also evaluate and feedback intent fulfilment information (e.g., the intent is satisfied or not).\n† Note 3: Intent/Experience Level rating does not mean that intent-driven approaches are only applicable at Level 4\nand Level 5. It means that the expectation of a L4 system is that it can delegate and respond to tasks with a higher\ndegree of abstraction. Intent driven interactions achieve this abstraction.\nThe system delivers assisted monitoring capabilities, which means all dynamic tasks have to be\nLevel 0 - Manual\nexecuted manually.\nmanagement\nIn Level 0 Zero-X business capabilities are not applicable.\nThe system executes a certain repetitive sub-task based on pre-configured to increase execution\nLevel 1 - assisted\nefficiency.\nmanagement\nIn Level 1 Zero-X business capabilities are only available to an individual element.\n© TM Forum 2021.

The system possesses closed loop\nLevel 5 - Full automation capabilities across multiple services, multiple domains, and the entire lifecycle, achieving\nautonomous network autonomous networks.\nIn Level 5 Zero X business capabilities are available to E2E full lifecycle operations of any services.\nThe AN Level Framework illustrates the combination of both human operators (P) and autonomous systems\n(S) involved in achieving autonomy and proposes the following lifecycle management categories in the\nevaluation of autonomous networks levels:\n• execution,\n• awareness,\n• analysis,\n• decision,\n• intent/experience.\nThe lower levels (L0, L1, L2) can be achieved now and deliver immediate cost and agility benefits in certain\nscenarios. An operator can then evolve to higher levels, gaining additional benefits and addressing a wider\nrange of scenarios. Network automation is a long-term objective with step-by-step processes, from\nproviding an alternative to repetitive execution actions, to observing and monitoring the network\nenvironment and network device status, making decisions based on multiple factors and policies, and\nproviding effective perception of end-user experience. The system capability also starts from some service\nscenarios and covers all service scenarios. This transformation will take several years to fully develop, and\nso the autonomy levels provide a graduated process of introducing automation with autonomy capabilities\ninto different domains to bring immediate value. A proposal for a methodology to determine the level of\nautonomy for particular tasks is now described in section 4.4.\n4.4 AN Level Evaluation\nNetwork operations consist of physical/logical objects and their state map for each object, all the\noperations are fulfilled by the intents that shift one entity to a desired specific status. The process of AN\nLevel evaluation could be taken as auditing the implementing phase of intent. Evaluating the autonomy and\nquality of the implementation of given intents in a specified system/solution. Considering the fulfillment of\nintents are cascading/iterating, the process and tasks fulfilling the intents are also grouped recursively, and\nthe iteration could be in great depth, in this case, the collecting of operation performance and automation\nratio cannot be carried out by a human, but better to be kept by the system itself, requirements and\nregulations for the statistic and reporting need to be addressed on this purpose. There is a cognitive\nprocess of human actions, including awareness, analysis, decision, execution, each intent implementation\nare a complete cognitive process instance, intents may be iterated, but if we only evaluate the first\niteration, or say level 0 or 1 in cascading, it will simplify the evaluation process. When compared to the\noverall system automation evaluation, it is suitable for humans to carry out the evaluating task.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved.

Generic Process of AN Level Evaluation\nEvaluation applies to “evaluation objects”, the first step of evaluation is choosing the “evaluation object” to\nbe evaluated. After the “evaluation object” chosen, we break down the operation process of the evaluation\nobjects into operation tasks, aggregate operation tasks into AI recognition processes and activities,\nevaluate and score operation tasks based on the task criteria( person, person-system, system), then\ncalculate the weighted average of operation tasks, obtain the scores of AI cognitive processes and\nactivities. Then, calculate the weighted average of the scores of AI cognitive processes and activities, and\nfinally obtain the AN level score of the evaluation objects.\n2. Control Loop Mechanisms\nNetwork autonomy can be implemented in different closed control loops across the operational layers, but\nthe complexity of network autonomy depends on the layer. It will be a greater challenge for the AN to achieve\nthe network autonomy in a cross-domain layer rather than within a single domain layer because more\nautonomy mechanisms need to be introduced for the coordination across different domains.\nFollowing are potential scopes of Autonomous Network Level:\n• Business control loop layer; business is the managed object in this layer.\n• Service control loop layer. Service is the managed object in this layer.\n• such as mobile 2C services , home broadband services, etc. Resource control loop layer.\nResource/network is the managed object in this layer, such as home network, wireless network,\nfixed access network, IP metro network, etc.\nThe Autonomous Network Level in this version is applicable to service closed loop layer and resource closed\nl oop layer.\n© TM Forum 2021.

Operation -flow\nBased on the best practices, each operational layer of the autonomous network can be decomposed using\nthe following operation lifecycle -flow:\n• Full-lifecycle -flow in Business layer: Including customer lifecycle management processes and\nproduct/offering lifecycle management processes.\n• Full-lifecycle flow in services layer: Including the flow of resource facing services planning, build,\nfulfillment, assurance. Also includes the flow of customer-facing services planning, build, fulfillment,\nassurance.\n• Full-lifecycle flow in Resource layer: Including the flow of resource/network planning, build,\nmaintenance, and optimization.\nFurther decomposition of the operation flow of services closed loop and resource closed loop allows us to\nobtain the following sub-flow:\nTable 5 Decomposition of Control Loop Operation Processes\nOperation - Sub-flow Description\nflow\nPlanning Network planning Based on the customer's business intention, service development\nobjective, network construction plan, and network capacity\nanalysis and prediction, output the network planning solution.\nBased on the planning solution, the network survey, equipment\nprocurement, and technical requirements of the solution, output\nthe network low-level design.\nDeployment Design and Based on the networks low-level design, complete hardware and\ndeployment software installation and optimization, output acceptance reports,\nand complete equipment and network configuration (pass the\nacceptance criteria and ready for operation & maintenance).\nMaintenance provisioning and Configure services and networks based on service provisioning\nconfiguration requirements.\nFault Set monitoring rules based on the customer's O&M policies,\nmanagement monitor the services and network status in real time, detect faults\nor potential risks in a timely manner, demarcate and locate the\nfaults, analyze the root causes, and rectify the faults or potential\nrisks.\nService change Based on network change requests generated from monitoring\nand Network and troubleshooting, parameter optimization, and planning and\nChange design, Analyze the impact on user services ,output change\nconstraints (time window and service interruption time),\nformulate network change solutions, and implement the changes\nto eliminate network faults or potential risks and improve user\nexperience.\nOptimization Optimization Based on network performance tests, customer\nparameter complaints/feedbacks, and resource utilization, Formulate and\nadjustment implement network optimization solutions, to meet customer\nservice experience and resource utilization requirements.\n© TM Forum 2021.

Proposed Standardized Task\nBased on best practices, decompose the operation process and sub-process of services closed loop and\nresource closed loop into operation tasks.\nThe process and sub-process breakdown principles are as follows:\n• Completeness: All tasks in the workflow in the operation process must be included.\n• Balance: The division granularity of each task is relatively balanced and decoupled.\n• Uniqueness: The operation task does not overlap and does not have functional intersections.\n5. Task Level Evaluation Criteria\nA key criterion for determining the intelligence level of each task in L0 to L5 is to consider what agents are\nperforming the task：\n• Person: The task is completed by person, and no system assistance capability is available.\n• System assist person: The task is jointly completed by person and system. The main operations are\ncompleted by person and a few tasks are automatically completed by the system.\n• Person assist system: The task is jointly completed by person and system. The main operations are\nautomatically completed by system and a few tasks are completed by person.\n• System: The task is automatically completed by system.\n6. Control Loop\nControl loop is used to describe the necessary steps to fulfill certain management purposes. A workflow is\ncomposed of one or more management tasks. The autonomy capabilities of the tasks in the workflow may\nimpact the network autonomy level.\nFollowing are the potential categorization of the tasks in a workflow:\n• Intent translation: The group of tasks which translate intent from operator or customer into\ndetailed operations which may affect one or more of the following groups of tasks (i.e., awareness,\nanalysis, decision, execution), also evaluate and feedback intent fulfilment information (e.g., the\nintent is satisfied or not).\n• Awareness: The group of tasks that monitor and understanding what happening or exists in\nquality/state of network/services, such as collecting network/services information, preprocess\ninformation and selective notification, etc.\n• Analysis: The group of tasks which analyze data generated in the awareness phase, use\ntechnologies such as model inference and analysis to further predict the future change trend of the\nabove network status, and make a recommendation for decision.\n• Decision: The group of tasks that decide the necessary management operation for execution, e.g.,\nnetwork configuration or adjustment.\n• Execution: The group of tasks which execute the management operations and feedback the result\nto the intent requestor.\nFor example, the relationship between tasks and AI-based cognitive workflow in monitoring and\ntroubleshooting operation process is as follows:\n- A task group of monitoring visualization, fault identification, and risk prediction constitutes awareness.\n- Tasks group of problem demarcation and locating constitutes analysis.\n- Tasks group of solution generation, evaluation, and decision-making constitute decision.\n- Tasks group of solution implementation and verification constitute execution.\n© TM Forum 2021.

AN Level Evaluation Object\nThere are several dimensions to specify the evaluation objects, including: a. the service(HBB/leased line/…),\nb. the network(e.g., Wireless/fixed access/ipran/ip metro/etc.), c. the operation process (see Figure 4-1)\n8. Scenario\nThe evaluation object may have multiple scenarios based on internal and external conditions. For example:\n• Multiple fault types of networks in domain network assurance processes\n• Multiple Service-related device types in the multi-domain network fulfillment process\nThe network autonomy can be implemented for different scenarios, the complexity of network autonomy\ndepends on the detailed scenarios it applied. Also, it will be more challenge for the telecom system to achieve\nnetwork autonomy for full scenarios than for certain scenarios. For example, the autonomy applicability of\nnetwork deployment will be more challenging for a combined outdoor-indoor scenario than for an outdoor-\nonly scenario.\n9. Evaluation Method:\nDefines how to perform level evaluation based on the task and task criteria and specifies the evaluation\nprocess and calculation method. The procedure of the assessment method is as follows:\nStep1： Determine the evaluation object.\nStep2： Describe the operation process.\nStep3： Task Map to operation Task\nStep4： Evaluate the task level.\nStep5： Calculate the evaluation object AN level.\nStep6： Analyze and output the AN level evaluation conclusion.\n10.

It exposes a set of Business Services based on the capabilities of\na set of objects over which the AD exercises governance ( policy, rules, patterns including Closed\ncontrol loops),\n• Is self-managing self-scaling and manages its own lifecycle and publishes its Service Capabilities and\nBusiness Services in a Catalog / Repository.\n• Objects can include Intent-based APIs, management interfaces, (sub) Domain managers, Control\nloops, controllers, orchestrators, decision-makers, AI analytics, monitors, policies.\n• An Autonomous Domain is the lowest unit of composition of an Autonomous Network.\nAutonomous Network involve multiple layers and closed loops. Autonomous domains serve as the basics unit\nthat can fulfill the closed-loop automation of the lifecycle of specific network operations of Autonomous\nNetworks based on the business disposition of network functions and operations. This reduces technical\ncomplexity and conceals the variations of different vendor implementations, thus supporting E2E business\nrequirements of AN services.\nThe boundary of autonomous domains is based upon the network operation requirements and business\ndecision of each CSP. The instantiation of autonomous domain can be defined by CSP based on the factors\nsuch as service types, network technologies, deployment locations, and maintenance organization relationship.\nThe examples of autonomous domain instances can be the closed loops of access, metro backbone, core,\nedge, customer network from infrastructure perspective, or SD-WAN, VoLTE, CDN etc. from service\nperspective.\nThe basic principles of the operations of autonomous domains are:\n• Autonomy of individual autonomous domain: each autonomous domain runs in self-operating\nmode per business objective and hides the details of domain implementation, operations and the\nfunctions of the domain elements to the users of autonomous domains.\nCollaboration of cross autonomous domain: multiple instances of autonomous domains can be\ncollaborated by upper layers service operations using the intent-based interaction to fulfill the lifecycle of\nnetwork/ICT services.\nThe key characteristics of autonomous domains:\n• Can model the exposure of network and service capabilities as a platform and/or services to enable\nhigher-level business services to utilize network capabilities at the domain level instead of element\nlevel.\n• Can specify a set of rules at the business level (e.g., Service level availability, service level guarantee\nbased on response times, repair times etc.) that can be automatically monitored and effected across\nall domains of the architecture in support of closed loops.\n• Can be instantiated per business dispositions that represent network operations of the future e.g.,\naccess, edge, core, network services and so on.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 47 of 48\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\n• Each instantiation can be decoupled from another and expose a set of domain-based services via\ncommon intent driven interaction/ Open APIs to upper layer or other domains.\nFig 5.3 Autonomous Domains expose Business Services\nThe internal business capabilities are represented by the building block. Each Autonomous Domain exposed\nexposes services – Business Services - each exposing a part of the capabilities or Functionality of the\nAutonomous Domain. These Business Services are the basis of the Integration Pattern for Autonomous\nDomains. Business Services can be realized by collections of TM Forum Open APIs.\n5.2 Example of an Autonomous Domain\nFig 5.6 Implementation functions for implementing Autonomous Domains\n© TM Forum 2021.

CLOSED LOOP CONTROL\nAutonomous Domain is a composite structure\nThe Autonomous Domain must expose a precise boundary that only exposes control points for that domain\n(Figure 5-2). Several composition options for Autonomous Domains can be supported as shown below in\nFigure 5-1.\nFigure 5-2 Autonomous Domain Capabilities\nFigure 5-1 Autonomous Domains are composite\nAutonomous Domains can vary in scope depending on the delegation of responsibility to each Autonomous\nDomain by a governance authority. The governance authority chain of command is a separate\nconsideration not addressed in this section.\nAn Autonomous Domain enclosed within another domain means that part of the scope of responsibility of\nthe outer AD has been delegated to another Autonomous Domain but that the governance rules applied to\nthe out domain also apply to the inner domain. However, the inner Autonomous Domain may have\nadditional rules and constraints applied.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 49 of 50\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nAutonomous Platform\nA Platform is typically made up of many systems, associated processes, Information, and organization\nmanaged as a coherent unit to deliver a well-defined set of business/platform capabilities through simple\nto use Open APIs. A platform has a governance boundary that exposes one or more coherent blocks of\nbusiness functionality - 'the what '- that is realized using a combination of systems, people, processes, and\ninformation - 'the how ' [TR262].\nFigure 5-3 Platform versus Domain\nA subdomain is a domain that is a member of another domain.\n5.3 Multi-domain Collaboration and Autonomy\nAutonomous Domains can be both autonomous yet collaborative – these are the two key principles which\ndefine them:\n• Autonomy within Autonomous Domain: Each autonomous domain runs in self-operating mode per\nbusiness objective and hides the details of domain implementation, operations, and the functions\nof the domain elements to the users of the autonomous domains by using an abstraction layer of\nservice APIs.\n• Collaboration across multiple Autonomous Domains: Multiple autonomous domains are\ncollaborating and forming a new aggregated/cascaded domain, the cascading domains interact via\nan intent interface. Taking an example of the umbrella network manager (categorized as part of\nservice operation for now), which usually held by carriers while not a single vendor.\nFigure 5-4 Multi-domain Collaboration and Autonomy\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 50 of 51\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\n6 Intent-driven Interactions\nAutonomy in networks means that business, service, and resource operations are able to adapt decisions\nand actions dynamically to changing goals and requirements and cover a broad range of situations without\nhuman interventions. In this new environment, the business objectives of the operator as well as\nexpectations of customers and users need to be communicated to the software that constitutes an\nautonomous network. This is the role of intent. Intent describes the business objective of operators as well\nas the expectations of customers and users. In this respect, intent establishes machine-readable knowledge\nabout goals, targets, requirements, and constraints. Intent defines what an autonomous network is\nexpected to achieve, but it leaves the details of how a network is designed and operated to the internal\noperations of the network platform. This means that the smart software in the platform can constantly\noptimize how the service is delivered and we can incrementally add new technologies like Analytics and\nMachine Learning to constantly improve the implementation. For autonomous networks, the Intent-\ninteraction model is a must, not optional. The role of Intent is beyond relieving the burden of the user\nknowing implementation details. More importantly, it sets the autonomous system's internal goal. And the\nsystem then takes proactive actions to achieve the stated goal based on its observation of the\nenvironment. So intent is the fundamental mechanism to utilize the service of the autonomous networks.\n6.1 Intent and Intent Evolution\nThe term intent appeared in telecommunication and IT already in 2014 as “intent-driven networking” in the\ncontext of Software-defined Networks (SDN). Consequently, many early implementations of intent\nappeared in SDN controllers in 2015 and 2016. The early use of intent in SDN was very in a technical\nnetwork context and was directly involved in selecting alternative policies. The intent was either initiating\nprocesses or it was used in branching within decision trees while provisioning and managing SDN assets.\nThe definition of intent at the time reflected this use of intent. For example, in 2015 IETF states that intent\nis “An abstract, high-level policy used to operate the network.”\nIn the meantime, the understanding of intent as a concept and its role in automation has evolved from the\npolicy and rule’s centric view towards being a universal entity for declaring and communicating goals,\nrequirements, and constraints. The direct link to implementation assets such as policies and processes\nbecomes less eminent with the tendency to be explicitly excluded. Furthermore, the setting of intent is\noften directly linked to human expectations and choices. In this respect, IETF has presented a new\ndefinition of intent in 2020, now intent is defined to be: “A set of operational goals that a network should\nmeet and outcomes that a network is supposed to deliver, defined in a declarative manner without\nspecifying how to achieve or implement them.”\nThis example shift in definition can be observed throughout literature and standardization. The speed of\nthis transition might vary, but a common direction is very evident.\nIn 2019 a technology assessment by Ericsson research did a broad overview of usages of intent throughout\nthe industry and academic publications. It summarized the findings in a new definition: “[…] an intent is a\ndeclaration of business goals, operational goals or states that a system should meet, without specifying\nhow to achieve them (i.e., not prescribing events, conditions or actions).”\nThe examples of newer definitions introduce the idea that intent is a declaration of goals independent of\ntheir implementation. Furthermore, it expands the scope of what intent describes and where it is used.\nBusiness and higher operational levels are in scope rather than just the network.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 51 of 52\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nThis newer definition of intent is also in line with the description of intent presented by ETSI ZSM:\n“Today intent-driven systems refer to intelligent software able to understand the user goals and\ntranslate automatically into a concrete prescription of service or network configuration.”\n“Intent is understood to be the information of knowledge objects describing these goals.”\nFrom the perspective of the user, these goals express the expectation the user has directly with respect to\nthe actions and behavior of the system. They might also formulate derived instrumental goals needed to\nfulfill human expectations.\nThe AN project definition follows the trend visible in the evolution of the intent concept and defines intent\nas follows:\n“Intent is the formal specification of all\nexpectations including requirements, goals, and\nconstraints given to a technical system”\nThis definition of intent focuses on the user perspective. The user has expectations, which are directly or\nindirectly expressed as goals, requirements, and constraints. This also means that the intent formalism\nmust be capable of expressing all semantics involved when users express their expectations that are\nrelevant for correct operation for an automated zero-touch domain.\nThese formally modeled and common semantics allow a technical system to understand what it is expected\nto do. It also implies that intent is encapsulated in self-contained objects, which can be exchanged over\nAPIs to communicate the user expectations and operational expectations.\nThe definition also points at completeness. All expectation is formulated by intent. From the system\nperspective, this means that all it needs to operate and optimize against is the set of intent given to it and\nnothing else.\n6.2 Implications of Intent\nIntent is “specification of all expectations including requirements, goals, and constraints” that applied to “a\ntechnical system”. We further deduce that intent will apply to certain objects/entities, that will be offered\nas the specification of the intent interface of the “technical system”. 3GPP defines intent as “a desire to\nreach a certain state/position for a specific entity”. That means:\n• intents apply to entities.\n• Intent is not “doing” something, but to make something in a certain state, with a clear objective and\ngoal.\n• The intent occurs on a specific working object, and the intent expresses the expectation of the state\nof a particular object, while the states usually consist of lifecycle status and attribute status, such as\nthe instantiation (appearance) of a service and the maintenance of its SLA attributes. Another\nexample would be a base station, its status shifts from unmounted in a warehouse to be deployed in\na site, then to completion of configuration and getting ready for service.\n• a specific “intent set” to be offered by a system.\n• Before interacting with a system, the supported “intent set” must be clear, describes the supported\nobjects and the states shifting graph, it could be catalog-based, or only described in documents.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 52 of 53\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nWith this “intent catalog”, the user or third-party system will know what you can do and what\nintents make sense in your system.\nSeparation of Intent from Intent Handling\nIf we define the intents as expectations on entities states, then “intent” is not a brand new concept, it has\nalways existed, even in the days of imperative UI/API based operation.\nOne difference is that, in the past, intent generation and implementation were all performed by human\nbeings and not a separate process. In autonomous networks, in is necessary to separate the “intent” and its\nrealization. Setting up an agent/handler, separating the interaction of intent and the agent/handler which\nhandling it, and the agent will fulfill the intent intelligently and automatically. It necessarily requires a clear\ndefinition of intents, a grammar for describing intents, abstracting the intents in different layers, and\nclarifying the mechanisms to dealing with the intent and lifecycle of intents. All these concerns and\nimplications will be covered in the following sections.\n6.3 General Properties of intent\nIntent is declarative It leaves room for the autonomous network to explore options for finding the\noptimal solution. Intent declares the wanted results rather than prescribing a\nspecific solution. Ideally, intent expresses a utility level goal that describes the\nproperties of a satisfactory outcome rather than requiring a specific outcome.\nIntent is The expectation expressed by intent originates from contracts and business\ninfrastructure strategy. It does not change if the underlying system is replaced or modified.\nagnostic and While implementation and capability differences between system vendors will\nportable continue to exist, intent can be ported between system generations and\nimplementations.\nIntent is complete Intent defines all goals and expected behavior. If it is not specified as intent, it is\nnot a goal the system needs to consider. This also means that concerns that were\ncommon sense in human-operated systems would need to become explicitly\nexpressed as intent.\nIntent is Multiple intents are given to the autonomous network, and it is expected to\ncomposable consider them all together. Unlike traditional software systems, where\nrequirements are analyzed offline to detect and resolve conflicts before\nimplementation, intents are added during run-time. Therefore, an essential\ncapability of an autonomous system would be to detect and resolve conflicts.\nIntent is persistent Intent is valid as long as the goals and requirements it expresses are relevant. For\nexample, an intent that specifies a service needs to be delivered would not\nbecome invalid once the service is initially provisioned. Intent is rather the reason\nfor keeping the service operational and assure its performance. Therefore, intent\nhas a life cycle that is actively managed by the user or function that has\ngenerated it.\nIntent is It uses measurable and ideally standardized metrics to define the target state.\nmeasurable This allows the automated evaluation of success as well as identification of issues\nand optimization opportunities.\nIntent is It must be understandable by humans while being formally and unambiguously\ncomprehensible specified allowing it to be processed by machines. It must be comprehensive in\nwhat it specifies for matching the semantics within the autonomously operated\ndomain, and the scope of autonomously operating tasks.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 53 of 54\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\n6.4 Classification of Intent\nService-specific intent\nService-specific intents are related to the delivery of a service instance. For example, the intent on business\nlevel could be to deliver a contracted service according to agreed functional specification and non-function\nrequirements expressed by target KPI. On the business operations layer, this is specified by Service Level\nAgreements (SLA) in combination with Service Level Objectives (SLO). In order to fulfill SLA and deliver the\nservice, the service operations layer would be involved by specifying the technical details of the service.\nThis specification corresponds to the technical requirements of an SLA defines as Service Level Specification\n(SLS). The fulfillment of the service might involve orchestration and that is steered by TOSCA models.\nTOSCA models allow the declarative specification of all service elements, needed resources, and their\ndependencies and topology.\nThis means that there are at least three different types of service-specific intent. Intent containing SLA\nwould be connected to service contracts on the business operations layer. Intent containing SLS and the\ntechnical specifications of SLA would be used to order a service from the service operations layer with all\nfunctional and non-functional requirements. Intent containing TOSCA models would be the input to the\norchestration subdomain of service operation.\nService-agnostic Intent\nNon-service specific intents or service-agnostic intents are globally applicable rather than valid for a single\nservice instance. They express global expectations. This can for example be minimum standards to be\napplied to the entire portfolio. While these intents are called non-service specific, they would therefore\ncontribute further details of how services are operated.\nFurthermore, non-service specific intents can address the expected behavior of the autonomous system\nincluding for example prioritization, risk-taking, or communication with humans.\nLegal, regulatory and standards compliance\nIt is important to follow legislation and regulation within the markets involved in service deliveries. Intent\ncan explicitly ask for the legislation or standards to follow and it might differentiate by market region. The\nlevel is also a choice if it is understood as meeting defined standards or integrating certain functions. For\nexample, the use of a minimum level of encryption as default within all network slice links can be a\nfunctional requirement of a service. Instead of defining this in every service individually, an operator might\nuse a global intent to specify this as a minimum default security level applicable to all services.\nFinancial gain and margin\nAutomated contract negotiation might be used for ad-hoc contracting of service without human\ninvolvement. A system capable of doing this needs the direction of what it is expected to accept or not.\nIntent can be used to define respective targets.\n“Common sense” Intent\nHuman common sense is what makes human operational decisions still superior to automation. It allows us\nto weigh in considerations and situational conclusions, which rely on experience and contextual knowledge,\nwhich might not be accessible to the technical system. For example, a human technician knows without the\nneed to be told explicitly that saving resources is an important concern. The technician also knows that\nsome customers are more important than others. This helps to correctly prioritize and plan beyond what is\npossible from observed data or specifications of services alone. When replacing human decisions with a\ntechnical system expected to deliver high-quality operation, common-sense considerations are critical to\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 54 of 55\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nthe model. However, based on the current state of the art it is not possible to be complete and reach the\nhuman level common sense with currently available techniques and tools. Nevertheless, it is still possible\nto cover many key concerns. Ideally, they are formulated as a utility, because that would immediately\ncreate review capabilities of actions and states.\nSave resources\nThe need to save resources is a typical example of a commonsense concern. It can be expressed for\nexample by defining resource value metrics and priorities per resource types. A good metric to base the\nintent on can be resource utilization, because only productively used resources generate income.\nAvoid unwanted bias\nA bias such as priority for high-value customers is a welcome feature. But other unwanted biases might\nundermine the reputation of the operator or even break laws. Examples are social/racial/sexual\npreferences exhibited by the autonomous operation. The root cause can be that bias in the training data\ndid lead to bias in the resulting ML models. Another source can be the bias that is introduced into policies\nfrom the prejudices of the developer. The operator choice would then be to use intent for setting goals that\nsteer the sensitivity of bias detection mechanisms with respect to certain types of bias.\nConflict resolution hints\nIntents will conflict with each other, and the zero-touch operations system would need to resolve these\nconflicts with optimized and balanced actions. For doing this it needs any kind of information indicating a\ngood prioritization strategy. For example, intent-driven metrics for customer or resource value can be used\nto convey valuable information for prioritization.\nBehavioral and Interaction Intent\nThe operator should have a choice of how the zero-touch system behaves and how it interacts with the\nhuman workforce.\nReporting frequency and scope\nIntent can be used to expresses what the system is supposed to report to the operator and what to include\nin logging and historical data recording. It can furthermore specify how to report with respect to formats\nand channels to be used.\nRisk-taking\nIf an automated system is allowed to act completely autonomously there is a good chance that unforeseen\nsituations will lead to actions that degrade the operation. This can happen if models are exposed to new\nsituations outside their intended scope. The operator might want to limit the risk the autonomous network\nis allowed to take and formulate the constraints using intent.\nEscalation to human decision\nThe operator can also define when the system is expected to not operate fully autonomously but escalate\ndecisions to a human operator. This can be the action wanted from the autonomous network if its\noperational actions were found to be too risky. The setting of respective thresholds and targets is also\nsubject to intent.\n6.5 Intent within the AN Framework\nTraditionally only the network professionals can understand network implementation technology, which\nhinders the service innovation and negatively impacts the customer experience. Intent driven interaction is\nan important bridge between business requirements and network implementation. Transforming business\nintent into services and related network resource requirements is crucial to achieving business goals. Intent\nrepresents the concerns and objectives of the users of an autonomous network. It, therefore, varies with\nthe diversity of user types and roles:\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 55 of 56\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nBusiness intent represents the objectives of a business user. This includes for example the delivery of a\ncustom application defined by SLA. Operators expect their autonomous network to operate service\ncontracts while meeting revenue targets. Their customers expect a good\nuser experience.\nService intent represents the objectives of a service user. A service is expected to deliver functional as well\nas non-functional attributes. This includes targets for example on connectivity, bandwidth, latency or\navailability.\nResource intent represents the objectives of resource users. Resources are expected to be allocated so that\nthe performance and quality of service targets are met.\nThis indicates that intents target a great variety of concerns across the Autonomous Network Architecture.\nTherefore, the handling of intent is distributed throughout the autonomous network layers and\nautonomous domains.\nThe interactions between different layers are through intent APIs. For example, business intent would be\nhandled in business operation and resource intent would be handled within the autonomous domain that\nmatches the concerns addressed by the intent.\nAn intent handling function is the basic architectural building block to assemble intent-driven operation.\nFigure 6-1 shows the intent handling function with its intent API. It receives intent, takes decisions if and\nhow to act, and then dispatches operational actions. The actions can be conventional API calls towards\nother functions. If the target functions have implemented intent handling, the operational activities can be\nto define their goals by using subsequent and typically more detailed intent.\nFigure 6-1 Intent Handling function\nFigure 6-2 illustrates by example how various instances of intent handlers are allocated across the layers\nand functional domains of the Open Digital Architecture. Intent can originate directly from user input\nthrough front-end portals. Additional intent would be derived automatically, for example from contracts\nand service orders. An intent handling function would operate its domain by analyzing the discrepancy\nbetween the observed state of the network and the wanted state expressed by intent. The main task of\nintent handling would be to close this gap as much as possible. It determines the optimal operational state\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 56 of 57\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\naccording to all given intent and then acts to transition the network into this state. This process includes\nthe resolution of inevitable conflicts between intent through prioritization and optimization.\nFigure 6-2 Autonomous Network operation based on Intent handling\nThe intent handling function can act by defining the goals of neighboring or subordinate domains through\nfurther intent. Furthermore, for all intent that is given to an intent handler, it is expected to report progress\nand status back to the source of the intent. This closes a loop. The intent mechanism is therefore\ninstrumental for creating control loops throughout the Autonomous Network Architecture.\nIntent Requests\nIntent-driven interactions within an autonomous network are interactions between various domain-specific\nintent handlers using the intent API. Intent originates from users through portals, or it is generated based\non other API calls. For example, an incoming service order would lead to the generation of a respective\nintent by contract and order management in the business operations layer.\nThe Intent API is concerned with the life-cycle management of intent objects. It is solely a knowledge\nmanipulation API. All domain-specific information is encapsulated within the Intent objects rather than\ndirectly mapped into API methods. This means the Intent API is domain-independent and applicable to all\ninstances of intent handlers irrespective of their allocation within the layers and domains of the ODA.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 57 of 58\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nSpecifying Intent\nExamples for the initial setting of intent are shown in Figure 6.4.\nFigure 6-4 Intent API: Sources of intent\nIntent handlers typically receive multiple intents indicating the desired state. They then decide on actions\nto optimally fulfill the intent and transition the system state as close to the desired state as possible. This\ninvolves setting intent in subsequent layers or neighboring domains within the architecture. Figure 6-5\ndemonstrates how subsequent intent is set within various intent handlers.\nFigure 6-5 Intent API: Subsequent intent and actions\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 58 of 59\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nWhen an intent is set, the receiving intent handler decides if it can accept the intent. The intent needs to be\nformatted in a way the intent handler can parse and process it. Also, the intent needs to contain semantics\nthe intent handler understands. This is the case if the intent contains expectations and supplementary\ninformation that matches the scope of responsibility of this intent handler. However, if the intent is\nunderstood, in the scope of the intent handler and matching its capabilities it might still not be able to\naccept it if it concludes it cannot fulfill the intent with the currently available means. If either of these\ncriteria are not fulfilled, the receiving intent handler would reply with a rejection stating the reason.\nModification and Removal of intent:\nIntent is generally persistent and stays valid until actively removed or modified. The entity that has\noriginally set the intent is responsible to manage its life cycle, including removal. It can be possible to\nmodel intent with a validity time or other pre-defined removal criteria. Whenever the criteria are met, the\nremoval process will be started automatically, and the intent origin would be informed about the\nautomated removal.\nAn intent handler can receive the request to modify and remove the intent at any time. It is important to\nnote, that the modified or removed intent is usually just one out of many intents valid for the intent\nhandler. Its modification changes the overall wanted state. This means that the intent handler would need\nto transition its operational state into a new target state optimal for the remaining set of intents. The intent\nhandler would dispatch actions accordingly.\nThe actions needed in reaction to intent modification or removal might involve the removal or modification\nof subsequent intent. If for example a service-specific intent is removed after a service contract got\ncanceled, the chain of subsequent intents that govern the service delivery would also be removed.\nUltimately, resources occupied by the service are released.\nReporting\nWhen an intent is set the intent handler is expected to report its fulfillment state. The report can be as\nsimple as sending a list of all metrics requested in the intent with the currently measured value. For\nrequested services, the current provisioning status (e.g., deployed, not deployed, degraded, …) would be a\ngood summary report in addition to the metrics.\nThe frequency and criteria for when a report is expected as well as additional content would be subject to\ndedicated intent or expectations within an intent. Example possibilities are:\n• Regular reports by time interval.\n• Event-based reports, for example, if major changes, such as incidents and degradation or the\nresolution of them occur.\n• No proactive reports, but the possibility to request reports is needed.\nAll these reporting options can be combined as needed.\nProbing\nProbing refers to sending an intent to an intent handler for testing its impact on the service and resource\noperation. Instead of including the intent into the live operation, the intent handler would deliver a report\nstating the expected fulfillment success of the intent if it would be set. This mechanism allows testing if an\nintent would be accepted and if not accepted, it can provide the reason why. Furthermore, it allows testing\nthe operational performance if the intent would be set. A more detailed reply might be available that\ncontains ranges or thresholds in KPI that are possible to fulfill. Probing can therefore be a key mechanism in\nintent negotiations.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 59 of 60\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nCollaborative judgment of alternative actions\nAn intent handler might be in the situation that it has found multiple alternatives with different properties,\nbut it is not able to decide on the best overall option. It can seek a judgment from the originator of its\nintents. This includes reports of potential detailed intent fulfillment for each of the options. The originator\nof the intent can then reply with a verdict about its preferences. This mechanism can also be used for\nescalations that involve human decisions.\n6.6 Intent-driven Management\nThere is a large gap between business requirements and network implementation. In the traditional carrier\nsoftware system, the EMS/NMS of a vendor provides northbound interfaces, and the OSS system performs\nthe system integration. In the future, the traditional integration mode will bring the following problems:\n• Multi-vendor differences still exist: Device details vary in different fields. Interface protocols,\nparameters, and capabilities vary from vendor to vendor. Interface standardization is slow, which\ndirectly affects the provisioning of new services.\n• Fine-grained API interface granularity: Traditional northbound interfaces are provided based on\nnetwork resource objects (such as VRF and interface). Although they can be flexibly used, service\nprovisioning on the live network is usually based on multiple technologies (such as composite VPN).\nMultiple interfaces need to be assembled and used together, and upper-layer services need to be\naware of specific service scenarios. In addition, different network technologies are selected for\ninvoking, which increases network implementation complexity.\n• More complex networks: In the 5G era, network devices are more complex, functions are more\ndiversified, and device management parameters are more diversified. If the current integration\nmode is used, the system integration time may be increased from 6 to 12 months to over 18\nmonths.\nIn the AN architecture, the entire network is divided into multiple Autonomous Domains. Each AD has self-\nmonitoring, self-configuration, and self-optimization capabilities. The upper-layer system can ignore the\nimplementation details in the AD, which simplifies system integration. When the upper-layer system needs\nto meet a customer requirement, the customer requirement can be broken down into one or more\nnetworks, such as \"end A to end Z\", \"bandwidth\", and \"latency\", without considering the technologies,\npaths, and parameters to be configured on the network.\nIntent refers to the requester's expectations of the network, service, or resource to meet and maintain a\ncertain desired state, but the intent does not describe the methods and steps used to achieve this state.\nGenerally, the intent has the following characteristics:\n• Customized language description: The network is regarded as a black box and the input information\nis customized parameters understood by external systems.\n• Concise/abstract: independent of vendors, resources, protocols, and implementation.\n• Declarative: Emphasize what instead of how.\n• Measurable/Verifiable: The intention should have clear criteria for evaluating whether the objective\nhas been achieved. In this way, when the indicator changes are detected, the system can\nautomatically adjust the objective.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 60 of 61\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nThe translation from user intents to network languages needs to be implemented hierarchically. Each lower\nlayer appears as a “black box” for the upper layer. The upper layer does not need to understand the\ntechnical implementation of the layer. The upper layer converts the objects understood by the upper layer\ninto resource objects understood and managed by the layer. The conversion process is based on the\ncontext of the current layer.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved.

A closed control loop is a mechanism in an\nautonomous system that accomplishes a task without human taking an active role during task execution.\nAn open control loop is where human operator starts, stops, or changes a goal or constraint related to a\ntask during task execution. From control theory, an open loop control system does not have a feedback\nloop and thus is not self-correcting.\nControl Loop within Autonomous Domain\nAs a purpose of an Autonomous Domain is to define the scope of autonomous behavior then one approach\nto implementation is for control loops to operate within an Autonomous Domain. The goals for a Control\nLoop within a Domain are set in part by the intent-driven tenant Management Business Service to support\nthe provision and operation of tenant services, and in part by the policies, constraints, and scope set by the\ngovernance authority through the AN Supervision and Control Business Service (see next section). This\nsimple starting point is illustrated below.\nFigure 7-1 Control Loop within a single Autonomous Domain\nThe operation of control loops across multiple Autonomous Domains is described later and is critically\ndependent on the definition of these two types of business services.\nClosed Control Loop Mechanism\nControl loops tie together a rich set of concepts. Figure 7-2 shows how control loop mechanisms can be\ndriven by an intent expression with a stated expectation or goal.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 62 of 63\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nFigure 7-2 Control Loop Mechanism of Autonomous Network\nThe Intent drives the control loop. Intent handling refers to a group of tasks that translates intent\nexpression from intent owner into detailed operations and/or policies that may affect one or more of the\nfollowing groups of tasks (i.e., awareness, analysis, decision, and execution).\n• Awareness: The group of tasks which include network and service data (e.g., configuration data,\nperformance data, alarm data, etc.) collection and necessary data pre-processing (e.g., data\ncleaning, filtering, statistics, etc.) with the purpose of monitoring network and service information\n(including network and service performance, network and service anomaly, network and service\nevent, etc.).\n• Analysis: The group of tasks that analyzes the obtained information or existing historical\ninformation to further predict the future change trend of the business, service or resource entities,\nand make a recommendation for decision.\n• Decision (-making): The group of tasks that evaluate and decide the necessary operation for\nexecution, e.g., network configuration or adjustment.\n• Execution: The group of tasks which execute the operations\nCooperative Closed Loops\nFigure 7-3 below illustrates how each phase or stage of the AADE control loop can be influenced by both\nhumans and machines. While the loop is always closed, i.e., there is no need for intervention by the human,\nthe possibility exists for either the human or machine to build an adaption into the control loop. For\nexample, an intent from an operator’s person could be a new additional constraint used in the analysis\nphase of the loop (see constraints in Figure 7-1). In Level 1, the machine has no decision-making authority\nand does everything the human says – as illustrated by the position indicator (red circle) in Decision-making\nis set to ‘human’). Going up through these levels, the machine can either provide options to the human,\nchoose for the human, or even be completely independent of the human in level 5.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 63 of 64\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nFigure 7-3 Responsibility can be shared across the control loop\nThe sharing of responsibility will vary per situation, per operator, per human, and per instance. This\nresponsibility is again best viewed as a continuum controlled by a slider that adjusts the level between the\nhuman operators and the autonomous systems.\nIntervention Capability\nFollowing on from this close cooperation between humans and machine ( or heteronomy) we also must\nexplicitly handle a take-over request from the human. The capability of the supervisory layer to intervene is\ncritical to allowing a layer of abstraction autonomously. This allows the supervisory layer or higher layer of\nautomation to confidently allow autonomous behavior, as it can always intervene in case of exceptional\ncircumstances and during the phase of confidence-building. In the Autonomous Driving realm, this is\nsometimes referred to as a request-to-intervene (RTI) and is very important for the Level 3 level of\nautomated driving.\nCognitive Closed Loops\nCognition is the process of understanding data and information and producing new data, information, and\nknowledge. A cognitive control loop selects data and behaviors to monitor that can help assess the status\nof achieving a set of goals, and produce new data, information, and knowledge to facilitate the attainment\nof those goals [ENI]. As such, a cognitive control loop resembles the human brains cognitive skills in\ninferring, reasoning and understanding its environment. The awareness and execution part of the control\nloop relate to sensing and effecting the environment, but the analysis and decision processes are elevated\nby collecting operational knowledge and autonomously learning from experiences in past decision loop\ncycles. For example, in the analysis stage of an AADE control loop, another inner control loop may be used\nto process additional contexts and infers from a knowledge base or from AI/ML trained model and then\nultimately adapts its analysis before passing this to the decision stage of loop.\nMultiple Control Loops across AN Architecture\nThe AN Business Architecture provides for multiple overlapping Control Loops operating across multiple\nBusiness layers. The notion is that these Cross-Layer Control Loops provide the coordination, and\noptimization of the individual Autonomous Domains so that they collectively optimize across domains as\nwell as with domains.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 64 of 65\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nThis can be affected by creating a model for how control loops operating across domains by coordinate and\ninfluence the control loops within an inner domain. This can be achieved by outer Control Loops and Outer\nDomains controlling the inner control Loops of inner domains through the AN Supervision & Coordination\nBusiness Service of an inner control loop. Critical to this model is the self-similarity of the Domain /Control\nLoop model at all levels of granularity and scope. Such an approach has been documented in IG1177 ODA\nIntelligence Management Implementation Guide R18.5.1, which links the needs of Autonomous Domains\nand ODA and is an evolution of ETSI GANA work [GANA]. It defines for ODA how such a hierarchy of control\nloops can work by the implementation of ODA Intelligence Management functionality, and the use of the\nDecision-making Elements (DE) to execute a design template which includes governance, policy, goals, and\nownership principles, exposing the desired customer-facing services (CFSs) to ODA Core Commerce\nManagement. The outcome is the definition and description of:\n• Governance and Policy requirements\n• Generic information relating to Peer Domains within the Federation of Domains, and the embedding of\nAutonomic/Cognitive capabilities within ODA Intelligence Management\n• The main KPIs to be exchanged at Federation Reference Points ODA Intelligence Management\nfunctionality, and the use of the Decision-making Entities (DE) to execute a design template which\nincludes Governance, Policy, Goals and Ownership principles, exposing the desired customer-facing\nservices to ODA Core Commerce Management.\nThe outcome is the definition and description of:\n• Governance and Policy requirements\n• Generic information relating to Peer Domains within the Federation of Domains, and the embedding of\nAutonomic/Cognitive capabilities within ODA Intelligence Management\n• The main KPIs to be exchanged at Federation Reference Points\nFederation References Points in ODA Intelligence Management correspond to the AN supervision and\ncontrol business services.\n7.2 Evolution of Control Loop Mechanisms\nControl loops as managed entities are implemented by management systems, at both BSS & OSS levels for\nseveral years already. However, at the current time, it seems that technical foundations for cognitive-based\nloops are not fully stable. The implementation of AN based control loops depends on the evolution of\nmultiple areas:\n• Standard agreed levels of network automation – The definition of these will support bring the scale\nof automation into a single architecture, which will let the telecommunication industry to create an\nevolution path to automation.\n• Managed Entities Behavioral Models – Automation Networks require the development of higher-\nlevel abstraction infrastructures for behavior at areas that are not yet sufficiently evolved, mainly\nfor Intent Management. These include data models and APIs for concepts like: Intent,\nRequirements, Capabilities, Behavior, Decisions. Such concepts should have standard data models.\n• Standard definition of Business Services – such definitions are already available from several\nstandard organizations yet may require multi-SDO alignment.\n• Standard definition of autonomous domains – such definitions are required to set the governance\nlimits among systems that are now acting autonomously.\n• Control loops Operational Models – The decomposition of closed loop to standard types of activities.\nSuch models already exist. Please see section 7.2.2.\n• Standard Control loops Data models and APIs\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 65 of 66\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\n• Control Loops Lifecycle Operation Definitions – The management of control loops as first-class\nmanaged entities require standard lifecycle operations (see section 7.2.3).\n• Technical Infrastructures – some infrastructures such as policy frameworks and cloud management\ntools are already identified as a baseline for autonomous management systems.\nThe diagram bellows shows a map of the different levels of concepts and infrastructures that are reflected\nin the technical evolution of control loops.\nFigure 7-4 Evolution of Control Loop Modelling\nAN Control Loop Lifecycle Management\nControl loops become first-class managed entities as part of AN framework. This means that the AN\nframework should support their lifecycle operations. There are two levels of lifecycle management:\n• Control loop Specification – The specification level of the control loops where the behavior of the\ncontrol loop is determined. The specification is often implemented by a template.\n• Control loop Instance – The specific instance-level control loop. Control loop instances are\ngenerated by various level management and orchestration components, using the guidelines and\nrestrictions as specified in the control loop specifications.\nA Control loop specification may go through the following operations:\n• Create\n• Modify\n• Activate/Deactivate/State change\n• Delete\nA specification can be used for instantiation only when it is in an active state.\nOften, the specification of the control loop is used by multiple software components, and it needs to be\ndistributed among them. The distribution of the initial specification or changes to the specification is\nconsidered to be embedded in these operations, provided by underlying framework infrastructures.\nA Control loop instance may go through the following operations:\n• Create (instantiated)\n• Modify\n• Activate/Deactivate/State change\n• Delete\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 66 of 67\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nFigure 7-5 Control Loop Operations\nAN Control Loop Operational Models\nExtensive research work has been done by research organizations and SDOs on generic operational models\nfor autonomic networks. Key examples of that are:\n• IBM MAPE (An architectural blueprint for autonomic computing)\n• The CASCADAS project (Component-ware for Autonomic Situation-aware Communications, and\nDynamically Adaptable Services)\n• FOCALE (Foundation - Observe - Compare - Act - Learn – rEason. FOCALE – A Novel Autonomic\nNetworking Architecture)\nThese include proposals for models describing how the various functional components of autonomous\nnetworks should communicate for achieving the goals of the autonomous network. Each of these models\nhas a specification of an Autonomous Element (AE) and second level describing the inter-relationships\namong the AEs. ETSI GANA (Generic Autonomic Networking Architecture) conducted related research\nproviding recommendations how this should be implemented by CSPs. It is assumed that these will\ncontinue to evolve during the coming years, so a good approach is to support a wide set of options for\nconnectivity of the key autonomous management functions, possibly by a message bus, as suggested in\nsome of the models (FOCALE for example).\nFigure 7-6 FOCALE – the Autonomic Computing Element and Closed Loops\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 67 of 68\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nThis guide does not assume a specific computing model. The examples are closer to the IBM MAPE\nlanguage. Yet, nothing in the described framework is binding it to a specific model.\nAN Control Data Model Concepts\nAs the control loop is a managed entity, it requires a data model to support its operations. Looking at the\ncontrol loop top-level structure, we can observe its data components:\n• Control loop Scope – This is a set of managed entities that the control loop intent is applicable to.\nThese can be products, services or resources, based on the level that the control loop is operating\nat. The scope of the control loop has to be included in the boundaries of the autonomous domain.\n• Control loop Intent (Goal) – Any Control loop needs to have an intent expressing a goal. The pattern\nthat is used to describe the goal depends on how the behavior of the managed entity (the scope) is\ndescribed. The most common pattern for an intent is to target KPIs specifying target values to reach\nor to maintain. In specific cases the terms SLO (service level objective) or OLA (Operational Level\nObjective) are used. A requested state is another commonly used pattern when a state machine is\nused for managing the operational behavior of a managed entity.\n• Control loop Decision (optional) – A control loop may follow a decision, a line of action that guides\nits behavior. Having this guiding decision is not mandatory for any control loop, the behavior can be\ndetermined at a tactical level without following a decision, yet it may be applicable for some cases.\nExamples for such conceptual decisions at different levels may be: “Select X as a partner”, “refund\nthe customer”, “increase capacity even at higher costs.”\n• Control loop Implementation – To reach the required intent, a set of activities needs to be set and\nactivated. These activities correspond to one of the operational models. For example, if the FOCALE\nmodel is used, the types of activities may be derived from the model (e.g. Observe, Compute, Act...).\nThe activities follow a flow that may be static or dynamic. In many of the current flows, there is a\nlinear, unconditioned flow of activities, such as: monitor->analyze->plan->execute. However, flows\ncan be dynamic, and the next activity can be decided by the result of the previous one. For example,\nif a monitoring activity discovers a potential severe SLA violation, a customer account system may\nbe involved in deciding on the course of action.\nFigure 7-7 Control Loop high-level conceptual model\n© TM Forum 2021.

It aims to describe how AI, and more\nspecifically machine learning approaches, can empower network elements, networks, and management\nsystems to make better decisions and also looks at how the AN Framework can integrate this “network\nintelligence” with the planning, construction, maintenance, operation, and optimization of telecom\nnetworks operations management systems.\n8.1 AI in AN Technical Architecture\nIn future automated networks, AI/ML will become ubiquitous as a core component of network operations\nand maintenance intelligence. Considering the hierarchical characteristics of networks and management\nsystems and the differences in IT resource requirements at each stage of the AI application process\n(knowledge acquisition, training, and inferring), it is, therefore, necessary to build AI capabilities in each\nlayer of the network to support an automatic AI-driven closed loop at each layer, and thereby achieve\nintelligence for different scenarios, and ultimately to realize autonomous networks.\nTwo modes of AI usage:\n• Development Mode (Sandbox): utilizing cloud computing resources and network data assets for AI-\nrelated data governance, model training, and providing AI models for the application layer.\n• Runtime Mode (Production): The AI model provided by the development mode is used for real-time\ninferring and intelligent decision-making at each level of the architecture to achieve an autonomous\nclosed loop at the network layer, and AI capabilities can be provided to internal and external\nsystems to provide intelligent capabilities to the upper-level operational applications.\nLayered Intelligence\n• “Cloud + AI”– an open Knowledge and Intelligence platform, accelerate network AI innovation and\ndevelopment.\n• “Management layer + AI” − involving AI Inference framework, promote intelligent analysis and\ndecision capability in the management layer.\n• “NE + AI” − Make the network real-time perceptible with built-in AI chips and sensors, enabling data\ncollection acceleration and rapid inference at the edge.\n© TM Forum 2021.

Page 70 of 71\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nFigure 8-1 Layers of AI and Network Intelligence in AN Reference Architecture\nThe Knowledge and Intelligence platform is a centralized design and development platform and is the\nsource for the digitization of operations, network and human expert knowledge. Since AI model training\ntypically requires significant computing power, it is generally recommended that knowledge extraction,\ndata governance, and model training be performed in a cloud environment. At the same time, cloud AI\nplatforms require the ability to publish and share models, which can reduce redundant development,\nfacilitate model/knowledge sharing, replication and promotion in multi-location and build AI ecosystem,\nand be the \"knowledge center\" and \"library\" of the whole network. Cloud AI also needs to support cross-\nlayer, cross-domain, and cross-vendor AI capability construction to reduce duplication of investment.\nThe localized Intelligence includes management domain Intelligence and network element intelligence\n(“Site AI”). Management domain Intelligence provides an online AI inference service for the hierarchical\nautonomous network, focusing on real-time collection and filtering of network data and it is central to the\noverall network intelligence implementation. Due to the limitations of AI computing power and storage\nspace, it mainly focuses on local real-time perception analysis and decision processing.\n8.2 Developing and using AI Models\nThe development and deployment of AI models in telecoms face significant challenges:\n• High data sensitivity\n• Difficulty in obtaining sample data\n• High requirements for model accuracy\n• Model generalization is difficult\n• Demanding inference environment\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 71 of 72\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nAn end-to-end closed loop process is therefore required for AI development and application to achieve\nbetter model precision and outcome.\nFigure 8-2 Closed Loop process for Model Development and Inference\nData Service\nData Service provides security guarantee for the whole life cycle of data collection, transmission,\nmanagement and release, supports data traceability and data trajectory visualization through log\nmanagement, supports data life cycle process traceability and auditable operation, and prevents malicious\ndenial. In the data collection phase, it desensitizes personal private data and provides differentiated control\npolicies for different information security levels and personal private data.\nData Service provides a one-stop toolchain for data collection, storage, analysis, modeling, governance and\npublishing, as well as intelligent data labeling capabilities to help users quickly complete high-quality data\npreparation for model development and training in the telecom field.\nModel Training\nThe technical learning curve for AI model development in telecoms is high, requiring developers to\nunderstand both AI and network. Experts in telecoms have fewer AI skills and experience to draw from.\nWith the large number of available AI algorithms and the wide range of ML toolsets, it leads to high “trial\nand error” costs and low overall efficiency. Therefore, it is required to establish a one-stop training\nplatform and development process to ensure efficient model development and improved efficiency\nthrough a “wizard”-style development interface.\nThe basic model development process includes:\n• Dataset Management\nImports data used by the model to be trained; provides the maximum value, minimum value, average\nvalue, standard deviation, and visualized data distribution tool to evaluate and analyze data quality; and\nprovides the intelligent error correction tool to correct data errors.\n• Feature Engineering\nProvides tools such as chi-square, information entropy, and normalization to analyze and extract features\nfrom sample data and provides visualized feature extraction and data analysis results.\n• Model Training\nWeb style IDEs are required, online and offline collaborative model development should be supported, and\nmainstream AI algorithm frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, MXNet, and vendor-developed AI\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 72 of 73\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nframework MindSpore8 also considered to be supported. Tasks can be concurrently submitted for multiple\nmodel “trainings”.\n• Model Verification\nProvides a model verification environment to verify the model accuracy.\n• Model Publish\nProvide a one-click publish function to publish the model to Marketplace for download.\nMarketplace\n• Provide model repository function, provide a publishing place for the developed models, manage\nand monitor the models running on the ground and re-training management.\n• Support the browsing and ordering of application models, automatic update and installation\ndeployment, and grayscale publishing. Support convergence and scheduling of multiple models.\nInference Framework\n• Inference execution: model compatibility should be considered in the inference stage, e.g.,\nsupporting models developed from deep learning frameworks like Tensorflow, machine learning\nones such as MLLib, and even support for trained models that could be running on Python/Java-\nbased AI framework. Support multi-model inference execution, regular scheduling, and provide\nexternal API interface.\n• Model retraining: Create retraining services based on model packages, create retraining tasks by\nchanging input parameters, generate new model packages, and support retraining scenarios with\nonly data changes and cloud-based collaborative retraining scenarios.\n• Inference evaluation: Support manual or automatic evaluation of inference results by users, support\nvisualization of inference, query history of inference and output statistical reports.\n• Local Optimization: It supports automatic re-training based on local labeled sample set and\nincremental learning with online data to ensure model accuracy. Users can flexibly define re-\ntraining policies according to AI scenarios (e.g., re-training starts if the model accuracy is lower than\n75%), evaluate the model based on local samples, and select the optimal version for the model\nupgrade.\nStandardization is needed for AI Models\nThe development of AI models is not a “one-time-only” process. As the network changes so too must the\nmodel. It is necessary to unify the management and continuous optimization of the model through the\ncloud AI platform to ensure that the accuracy of the model meets production requirements. The\ndevelopment of AI-related specifications is key to ensuring efficient collaboration between AI cloud and\nlocal clouds, to achieve the efficiency of cloud-local connectivity, and to support the exchange and flow of\nmodels and data. AI specifications that are required include AI Data Specifications and AI model\nspecifications. The data specification is used to shield the differences between different vendors' device\ndata, and the model specification is used to unify the operating environment of different vendors' device\nmodels to ensure that AI models and knowledge can be flowed and shared.\nTM Forum’s AI Project team are advancing proposal in the area of AI Model specification and have\npublished Open API specifications in the area of Data Governance.\n8 https://github.com/mindspore-ai/mindspore\n© TM Forum 2021.

The perceptual\nlayer, which is the computer's visual, auditory, tactile, and other perceptual capabilities. Humans have\nmade important breakthroughs in the field of voice recognition, image recognition, and other perceptual\nfields, and machines have become closer and closer to humans in terms of perceptual intelligence. The\nsecond layer is the cognitive layer, which refers to the machine's ability to understand the world and have\nthe ability to think. The cognitive world is realized through the accumulation of a large amount of\nknowledge. In order for the machine to gain cognitive ability, it is necessary to establish a rich and accurate\nknowledge base. The knowledge graph is a key measure of the machine's cognitive ability. A Knowledge\nGraph describes concepts, entities and their relationships in the objective world in a structured form,\nexpresses information in the network in a form that is closer to the human cognitive world, and provides an\nability to better organize, manage and understand the vast amount of information in telecommunication\nnetworks. The knowledge graph aids semantic search, but also shows great power in intelligent question\nand answer and operation and maintenance assistance. Together with big data and deep learning, the\nknowledge graph is one of the core drivers of the Internet and artificial intelligence.\nFigure 8-5 Knowledge is connecting the dots (graphic by David Somerville)\n© TM Forum 2021.

Page 75 of 76\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nA knowledge graph is a data model that can assemble a \"knowledge\" network containing large numbers of\nentities, attributes, and relationships providing experts with a fast and convenient way to retrieve and infer\nknowledge. The core is to observe and perceive the world through data and realize intelligent services such\nas classification and prediction and automation. As an important repository of expert knowledge, the\nknowledge graph promotes information searching, intelligent question and answer, and many other\nintelligent applications.\n8.4 AI in common telecoms use cases\nIn this section we identify four key telecom AI use case categories :\n1. Perception and Prediction\n2. Detection and identification\n3. Control optimization\n4. Process optimization\nPerceptual and Prediction\nTaking BTS9 energy saving as a typical example, where energy saving is achieved by controlling the\nswitching time of BTS carrier amplifiers, the key is to make a judgment based on cell traffic trends. In this\ncase, it is unrealistic to rely on the manual or human prediction of massive BTS traffic. The LSTM10 neural\nnetwork algorithm can predict the future PRB traffic time series through the historical time series of PRB\ntraffic, and then configure the energy-saving switching strategy of each base station.\nDetection and Identification\nTypical applications such as fault identification and root cause location, which is a long-standing problem of\nnetwork operations and maintenance, a base station power failure will lead to transmission, base station\ndecommissioning, power environment and other 11 work orders, how to quickly locate the root cause,\nreduce invalid work order distribution to save maintenance costs need to be addressed. Frequent item\nmining, clustering, knowledge graph are all AI technologies that can achieve root cause location.\nControl Optimization\nControl optimization is a common field of AI technology in the field of telecommunications, such as 5G\nantennas, horizontal beam, vertical beam, antenna down-angle, antenna azimuth constitute tens of\nthousands of combinations, artificially need weeks to find a better combination of parameters, but the\nintroduction of AI can rely on reinforcement learning and deep learning to quickly find the optimal\ncombination from a large number of parameter combinations, to maximize resource utilization.\nProcess Optimization\nRobotic Process Automation (RPA) is an AI application where people configure robots to mimic and\nintegrate the interaction between humans and data systems and thus automate business processes. By\nusing a user interface (UI) to capture data and restore human operating processes, machine learning and\ndeep learning are used to solidify a large number of repetitive operating processes in the telecom network\noperations and maintenance process, replacing humans with machines to achieve 24/7 automated\noperations. Meanwhile, in certain complex scenarios in the telecom field, it is necessary to combine the\nabove multiple capabilities to solve specific problems. This combination, termed “AIOps”, has gradually\n9 Wireless - Base Transceiver Station (BTS)\n10 Long Short-term Memory (LSTM)\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AIOps is a key service in the evolution of telecom network\nintelligence and a key capability that enables automated driving networks. The service capabilities used\ninclude KPI anomaly detection, log anomaly detection, fault identification and root cause localization, all of\nwhich can be flexibly arranged and combined to suit different business usage scenarios.\n8.5 AIOps Service Management\nThe need to operationalize AI\nLarge-scale deployments of AI create new opportunities but also additional challenges such as how to\noperationalize AI, i.e., how to deploy, operate, control, maintain and govern hundreds or thousands of AI\ncomponents which will eventually form part of core IT and network systems architecture. Unlike traditional\nsoftware, AI-based components may reason, make decisions, predict, learn, and evolve autonomously when\nexposed to new input data. AI components are more “black box”, i.e., opaque, and non-deterministic in\nbehavior. While this enables a more agile set of operating capabilities within the CSP it also significantly\nincreases risk. To that end, AI operations need to be compliant with emerging regulatory frameworks for AI\naiming to enable a trustworthy, responsible, reliable and secure development and adoption of AI applications\nand services. In the context of autonomous networks, this applies to individual AI software components,\nentire AI-driven autonomous domains, or even higher level cross-domain or business level processes.\nSometimes it may be necessary to control, or throttle, the level of autonomy that a given component has at\na point in time, and such decisions are informed by the operational processes used.\nTo address these challenges, TM Forum is leading an initiative to formulate an industry-agreed framework\ncalled “AIOps Service Management Framework”, which focuses on reengineering the software and service\nlifecycle processes required to operationalize AI software at scale. This framework enables operations teams,\nprocess owners and business users to exploit AI safely and properly, thereby maximizing its benefits,\nmitigating its inherent risks, and ensuring the appropriate level of quality, reliability, transparency, and\nregulatory compliance. The AIOps Service Management Framework complements the Autonomous\nNetworks Framework in that the AI operational processes defined in the former are a subset of the overall\nprocess required for autonomous operations defined in the latter. Both frameworks address ‘operations’ but\nAIOps Service Management Framework is squarely concerned with AI Applications Operations whereas the\nAN Framework develops the business and technology architecture more generally across business, service,\nand resource operations.\nAIOps in the Software Lifecycle\nThe AIOps Service Management Framework is agnostic to any specific software management methodology\nand is general enough to be inclusive of most software engineering lifecycles, including both traditional\n(waterfall or V-Model) and agile methodologies. AIOps SMF scope is on re-engineering operational\nprocesses in the following areas:\n• Deployment, representing the bridge or gate between the Development and Production stages.\n• Production, the subset of processes aimed to operate and maintain the services in Production live\nenvironments, including the Maintenance process.\n• Decommission, addressing the removal of a system release from Production.\n• Operations Governance, which includes the subset of governance processes that are needed to\nmanage and govern specifically the Deployment and Production stages of the lifecycle.\n© TM Forum 2021.

Figure 8-6 above shows the stages of the lifecycle\ncovered by the AIOps Service Management framework mapped on a general software development\nlifecycle.\nAIOps Service Management Framework\nTM Forum’s AIOPs Service Management Framework redesigns the service management processes needed\nto safely and effectively deploy, operate and govern AI components that are integrated within network and\nIT systems and architectures. These management processes need to cater to a ‘blend’ of AI and traditional\napplications that run side-by-side in CSPs’ operations. The figure below shows the AIOps Service\nManagement framework highlighting in red the processes that are currently in scope (IG1190).\nFigure 8-7 Processes in scope of the AIOps Framework\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 78 of 79\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nThe dynamic nature of AI software and its capability to learn and evolve autonomously, which creates a\ncontinuum between the Deployment and Production stages. AI components move from the ‘deployable’\nstate to the ‘live’ state and vice versa, blurring the lines between Deployment and Production. For this\nreason, we consider the Deployment and Production processes to be part of AIOps and we do not assign\nthem to any specific stage of the lifecycle. This will give companies greater agility in their operations, as\nthey can organize their processes and assign responsibilities to the teams according to their strategy,\nambition level regarding network autonomy, organizational choices, and operational context. The table\nbelow lists the processes that are currently within the scope of the AIOps Service Management Framework.\nTable 6 Processes defined within AIOps Service Management Framework\nProcess Description\nConfiguration Configuration Management ensures that all components (also called Configuration Items,\nManagement CIs) of systems and services are uniquely identified, baselined and maintained and that\nchanges to them are controlled across the whole service lifecycle.\nChange Change Management ensures a smooth transition of all changes to Production live\nManagement environments. It minimizes the risks, preserves the quality of service, avoiding incidents and\noutage, and prepares the final users/consumers to adopt the new capabilities/features.\nAcceptance Acceptance Testing ensures the overall quality against the expected targets of all new and\nTesting existing updated software and services, before declaring and certifying them as “operations\nready” and “deployable” to the Production live environment.\nRelease Release Management plans and manages the deployment of any software release (i.e.,\nManagement package of changes) from Development to Production environments (and in general, to any\nrelevant environment).\nKnowledge Knowledge Management ensures that reliable and complete information and knowledge is\nManagement available to the right parties (people, consumers, 3rd parties...) at the right time throughout\nthe service lifecycle.\nMonitoring & Monitoring & Event Management, monitors, detects, filters, and correlates all relevant\nEvent events occurring throughout the Production environments and initiates the corresponding\nManagement activities to respond to and address those events.\nIncident Incident Management addresses all events that have or could have relevant impacts\nManagement (outages, incidents, defects/bugs, operational issues, quality degradation ...) on the services\nand, in line with their priority, manages the recovery of the service operations according to\nthe agreed SLAs, minimizing the impacts on users and business processes and managing the\nnecessary communication.\nProblem Problem Management is responsible for the diagnosis of the root cause of incidents, issues,\nManagement vulnerabilities, and weaknesses related to systems and services, and, in line with their\npriority, ensures the permanent resolution of those problems, when appropriate.\nService Desk Service Desk Management is the process responsible for managing the lifecycle of all\nManagement different types of demands (Service or User Requests) submitted by the end-users to the\nService Desk.\nApplication Application Maintenance ensures the proper modifications of software and its components\nMaintenance after delivery to Production in order to improve their performance, quality, efficiency, or\n(incl. ML other relevant attributes. In AIOps, this process includes also the ML Training and re-training\nTraining) process (when applicable), predictive and self-healing maintenance activities.\nCapacity Capacity Management ensures that cost-justifiable capacity of services and related\nManagement components (software, hardware, network etc.) is able to deliver, the agreed service level\ntargets, presently and in the future, in a timely and effective manner in the specific context\nof the CSP.\nAIDataOps Being data, the fuel driving the operations and evolution of AI software, AI Data Operations\nmanagement (AIDataOps) become vital to ensure that the right data in Production are\nproperly collected, processed, transformed, stored, safeguarded, available and accessible at\nthe right time, according to the business needs, laws, regulations, security policies and\nefficiency drivers.\n© TM Forum 2021.

Autonomous\nNetwork as a term implies a more effective infrastructure, and this infrastructure may take several forms:\n• Intelligence in equipment design\n• Digital awareness and intelligence enabling\n9.1 Intelligence in Equipment Design\nLightweight Equipment in Wireless Sites\nTo simplify site construction and reduce site construction costs, high-density and integrated blade devices\nare required. Higher bands are used for 5G scenarios for the development of network services. Higher\nbands and more services require more sites, so more pole sites will be constructed in the 5G era.\nTo support fast and efficient deployment of massive sites, the following requirements should be met:\n• No reconstruction of site infrastructure. For example, do not add poles to or reinforce antenna\ninstallation platforms and do not expand power supply units (PSUs)\n• Improve energy efficiency and reduce energy consumption. For example, keep improving the low-\npower design for radio frequency (RF) and baseband unit (BBU) modules; power on and off devices\nbased on the service volume.\n• Design devices in all standards and allocate spectrums on demand. For example, enable 5G in RF\nand baseband modules; support spectrum sharing between LTE and New Radio (NR) in all\nscenarios.\n• With faster bit-rate growth of networks, base stations need to manage radio resources more\naccurately, improving the real-time data analysis capability of wireless networks and maximizing\nresource utilization.\nFiber Network Simplification\nUsually, the consideration of network simplification is holistic and end-to-end. For example, in the\nenvisaged autonomous optical network, the following design criteria should be followed:\n• One fiber to meet all services, one optical network covers home users, enterprise users, and 5G\ntransport scenarios.\n• One device to meet all services, especially for the convergence site.\n• Adopting the E2E dynamic slicing technology to provide comprehensive network protection and\ndifferentiated SLAs for various services.\n• Employ new architectures and technologies to sharply improve network resource utilization and\nperformance, e.g., all-optical backplane.\n© TM Forum 2021.

Multi-dimensional real-time sensing must be\nprovided, covering service flows, resources, topology status, O&M events, and power consumption.\nSite Intelligence Inference Framework\nFigure 9-3 Site Intelligence at NE\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 81 of 82\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1\nAs described in the previous section (Knowledge and Intelligence), the generic AI architecture of N will be\nlayered, including the centralized AI knowledge base and training service, and the local inference\ncomponents. Site Intelligence (SI) follows the same framework and especially benefits from the federated\nlearning technology, which resolves model generalization issues under customer data privacy protection\nand improves the business identification rate. Federated learning uses partial data of multiple nodes to\nlearn global models, fully exploiting the data value of different nodes and improving model training\nefficiency.\n9.3 Infrastructure Requirements\nThe study and regulation of infrastructure evolution are mostly handled by specific standard organizations\nin a particular domain, e.g., 3GPP for wireless access/core, ETSI F5G for fixed networks, ETSI NFV for\nvirtualized functions. The TM Forum cooperates with these organizations on the cross-domains aspects of\nthe network transformation towards AN. The TM Forum presents the need for simplification of\ninfrastructure as requirement input for AN evolution (see Table 7). The requirements related to the field\nneed to be highlighted by the corresponding domain standard organizations.\nTable 7 Infrastructure Requirements for SDO Cooperation\n3GPP ITU-T ETSI TM Forum\nLightweight equipment\nWireless Site Real-time NE awareness AI inference AI inference\nAI inference\nNormalized protocol\nSimplified\nCore Network Real-time NE awareness AI inference\narchitecture\nAI inference\nIP network AI inference AI inference\nLightweight equipment\nSimplified\nFiber Network Simplified architecture AI inference\narchitecture\nAI inference\n© TM Forum 2021.

If an\narchitecture has some malleable, morph-able quality that allows sufficient freedom in adaptation then it\nallows the details to be defined by the implementers and to discover particular implementations that meet\ntheir needs. Network complexity is not simplified by removing complexity. It is simplified when it is\n“sidestepped”, compartmentalized into autonomous domains, and then handled in a robust, consistent\nfashion (intent, closed loop automation) where the closed loops deal with known failures and end states\nrather than attempt to perfectly predict all eventual end-states. The complexity still exists of course but\nonly within the networks bounded context. The models we employ do not simply employ an abstracted\nview of the real complexity, but rather attempt to model the aspects that matter. When we say AN can\n“deal with complexity” in end-to-end networks we mean that the AN has developed a certain resilience to\nthe scale of the endless permutations of failure and the even greater number of optimal states for\nnetworks. In this sense, we say that the AN is context-aware. Knowing what you need to know when you\nneed to know it. This awareness brings clarity and purpose to the orchestrated flows (closed loops) that\ndrive operations. This AN technical architecture advocates the understanding of the platform's capabilities\nvia closed loop flows and the decoupling and “weak-linking” of platforms using intent. The separation of\ndomains into modular, redundant and diverse (multi-vendor) components allows AN to handle failure, risk\nin the complex networking world.\nThe AN Project Deliverables Guide (IG1260) summarizes the project’s published deliverables and also gives\nan outlook for how the TM Forum’s AN Project progresses into next year. We expect that future\ndeliverables will go into more detailed modeling aspects of Intent and Control Loops but also make\ncontributions on API standards in these areas.\nThe future of work and the future of network automation may evolve in a similar path towards autonomy,\nbringing more freedom for human workers. Autonomy gives some direction (intent), requires a little\nsupervision (human operations), but expects that the tasks are then completed by the machine with no\nhuman intervention. In traditional control loop approaches, we have relied on people to define policies. For\nAutonomous Networks, we expect that control loops will eventually become self-tuning and fully adaptive.\nHowever, a degree of human oversight is needed. At some stage, our ability to remove humans from the\nloop will not be a scientific decision but a business one [TATAN]. However, full autonomy does seem a high\nbar to reach right now, but with steady progress, level by level, we can reach the self-managing and self-\ngoverning future of Autonomous Networks.\n© TM Forum 2021.

Page 6 of 7\nIG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0\nExecutive Summary\nSeveral standards developing organizations (SDO) are actively working on the topic of\nAutonomous Networks and the associated concept of intent-driven management. One of the\nkey building blocks of intent-driven management is the intent meta-model which helps by\nproviding an abstract representation of the schema and rules of the intent model, irrespective\nof the management domain or specific management layer, and enables the extension of such a\nmodel wherever necessary, depending on the context of usage. This is critical because the\nmeta-model of the intent is one of the architectural considerations that can influence the\nfunctional blocks required for the overall autonomous network system to derive the semantic\nmeaning and context of the intent as well as helps to map intent to internal actions without\nambiguities or conflicts.\nThis study explores the approaches followed by different standardization organizations for\nintent meta modeling and highlights the readiness, relevance of use as a reference\nmethodology, and the context of usage that identifies what aspect of the SDO artifact can be\nleveraged. It should be noted that this study does not compare the SDO approaches directly,\nbecause the objective, context, and the maturity of intent-driven management specification\ndevelopment in the various SDOs considered are different. Hence, it is advised that this\ndocument is referred to as informative content and for identifying the best practices. This\nstudy helps CSPs to match the SDO intent modeling capability with the business requirement,\napplicability across wider use cases or spanning multiple domains. Additionally, depending on\nthe transformational stage of the CSP towards Autonomous Networks, an appropriate set of\ncapabilities can be planned and incorporated based on the overall scope and development\nroadmap documented by the SDOs.\nThe following table summarizes the intent meta-modeling approaches of different standard\norganizations and key characteristics.\nCharacteristics\nSDO Meta-model Intent Context of use (What Relevance (Relative\nApproach approach expression aspect of the SDO maturity to use as\nlanguage (DSL or artifact can be used for a standard intent\nSchema intent meta modeling?) meta-modeling\nspecification approach)\nformat)\nSemantic RDF/RDFS/OWL SKOS, RDF, RDFS, Simple : High , but can\nWeb based Ontology OWL or Turtle Taxonomy/Thesauri consider\nTechniques based evolutionary and\nAdvanced : intermediate steps\nOntology/Knowledge\ngraph based\nMEF DSL Restricted DSL Restricted Start simple with a Medium , DSL\nfor specific natural specific domain DSL limited to a specific\ndomain/Use language, and specialized DSL use case\nCase (SD-WAN) Restricted DSL processors\n© TM Forum 2021.

Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches\nTMF Specification IG 1244A (link: TBD) gives a formal representation of the intent meta-model\nand its relationship with the domain-specific information model. There are many techniques\nused across the industry verticals and SDOs for expressing intent meta-model (or knowledge\norganization schemes) in a machine-readable format. In this section some of these\napproaches are examined and also the context under which such approaches are applied is\nanalyzed.\n1.1. Semantic Web Standards (RDF, RDFS, SKOS, OWL) from W3C\nFigure 1. Semantic Web Stack (Source: Idehen, Kingsley Uyi. 2017. \"Semantic Web Layer Cake Tweak,\nExplained.\" OpenLink Software, via Medium, July 14)\nThese standards are a set of instruments developed by W3C for modeling semantic knowledge\nor linked data that enable large-scale integration of, reasoning on, the data on the web that\nhelps to realize semantic web vision of “Web of linked data”. Some important modeling\nspecifications in the semantic web stack that may be relevant for intent modeling are\ndescribed below.\nResource Description Framework (RDF): A standard format for exchange/interoperability of\ndata. RDF is available in various serialization formats such as RDF/XML (XML based syntax),\nTurtle, JSON-LD, RDF/JSON, etc. In simple words, RDF is used to represent simple relationships\nbetween concepts (subject, object, predicate).\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 10 of 11\nIG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0\nSimple Knowledge Organization Scheme (SKOS): is a data model representation to express\ncontrolled vocabulary (such as thesauri, classification schemes, and taxonomies) that can be\nexchanged between computer applications and published in a machine-readable format on\nthe web. SKOS is primarily used for indexing, information retrieval or for navigation purposes.\nSKOS represents Concepts (not Classes that can be instantiated unlike in RDFS and OWL)\nidentified with URI and grouped into a Concept Scheme. SKOS is represented using the web\nstandard such as XML and RDF (Resource Description Format).\nResource Descriptor Framework Schema (RDFS): A general-purpose language used for\ndescribing the properties and classes of the RDF resources (subject, object, predicate). RDFS\nserves as a base for ontologies. RDFS gives RDF more expressive vocabulary through classes,\nsubclasses, and properties.\nWeb Ontology Language (OWL): OWL semantic web language used to build ontologies or\nschema on the top of RDF datasets, describes relationships between classes and uses logic to\nmake deductions, express constraints in relations. It can also construct new classes based on\nexisting information. OWL is available in three levels of complexity -- Lite, Description\nLanguage (DL), and Full. OWL is based on RDF and RDFS. SKOS is an Ontology created in OWL\nfor representing controlled vocabulary, thesauri, and taxonomies.\nTo summarize, the above standard formats help to represent knowledge in a machine-\nreadable format with different levels of complexity and richness of semantic information it can\ncapture. For example, a domain level concept can be represented in a basic format like SKOS\nwith RDF vocabulary (for subject, predicate, object representation), a set of concepts (Concept\nschemes,) that share characteristics and relationships can be represented using RDFS or OWL\nbased classes, properties or individuals depending on the richness of vocabulary intended to\nrepresent the knowledge (RDFS vs OWL).\n1.1.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling\nAs stated above semantic web modeling languages are primarily used for interlinking data on\nthe web across domains and derive semantic information (based on the metadata and the\nrelationships) that can be used for various use cases such as web search, digital library,\nfinancial services, life sciences, etc.\nLeveraging the Semantic web modeling techniques defined above, intent can be modeled as\nsimply as a hierarchical taxonomy to a more complex ontology-based knowledge graph\ndepending on the expressive power and the reasoning complexity that can be\naccommodated. The following are some approaches that may be relevant for the intent meta-\nmodel.\n• Taxonomy/Thesauri based approach (Knowledge organization approach): Terms or\nconcepts (vocabulary of terms) organized into hierarchical or associative manner. Less\ncomplex intent vocabulary can be represented in a SKOS format. Taxonomy/Thesauri is\ntypically used to represent concept labels or search (the relationship between concepts for\ndisplay or for web search) that can be used for lookup or translation of intent through\nentity categorization, key phrase extraction, etc. This may act as a base for building the\nontology model.\n• Ontology and Knowledge graph-based approach (Knowledge representation\napproach): Ontology is used primarily for knowledge modeling focused on complex\nsemantics of concepts and the relations among concepts, their properties, attributes,\nvalues, constraints, and rules. Since intent is a semantic representation of goals that\nexpress requirements and constraints, ontology based Meta-modeling can be one of the\nchoices, which means ontology can be used as a base contract for defining intent, its\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 11 of 12\nIG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0\nscope, and boundaries. Ontology based meta-modeling also enables the extension of the\nintent schema and reuse/reference entities from existing domain-specific information\nmodels to create a more expressive and formal intent language.\nA knowledge graph is a collection of interlinked entities, and the ontologies form the base\nschema of the graph. Refer to the discussion here on difference or relationship between the\nknowledge graph and ontologies. Additionally, the Enterprise Knowledge white paper explains\nthe relation between Ontology and Knowledge graph with an example For an intent-driven\nsystem, an intent model with populated values (instances of ontology concepts or facts) can be\nrepresented as an element (semantic knowledge) of the knowledge graph. Knowledge graphs\ncan be an enabler for an intent-driven system especially when a) AI-based algorithms are\ntrained with the graph to derive contextualized knowledge or facts that can be used for further\ndownstream action b) a time series indexed inventory of intents can be maintained for audit or\nsystem recovery. However, the temporality of the knowledge graphs needs to be noted, which\nmay influence the static or transient nature and associated implementation requirements to\nsupport such characteristics.\n1.2. MEF Restricted Intent DSL\nMEF Intent-based orchestration project (W71) focuses on “developing common, multi-vendor,\ninteroperable, intent-based policies to support use cases, services, and standards”. There are\ntwo work items highlighted as part of the W71 specification work – a) Intent-based policies\nthat are defined as statements that express the goals of the policy in an\nimplementation/vendor/device-independent manner b) system architecture that supports\nclosed-loop, black-box “intent-engine”\nAt the time of this writing MEF, W71 is still under active development, however, the\ncontributions related to MEF intent DSL is worth referring here for the context of this paper.\nThe MEF DSL contribution (link, not a formal specification) focuses on a restricted intent DSL\nfor SD-WAN service catering to the Business User. A revised scope of the MEF 71 work item\nalso indicate the development of intent policy for SD-WAN through a separate project W85\nwhich includes Business user DSL, Application user DSL and compiler for both.\nThe intent DSL is expected to have the following characteristics:\n• captures the concepts for a particular domain or interface (for example SD-WAN, MEF LSO\nCantata) , for a particular type of user (e.g., Business user, Application Developer user,\netc.)\n• Specify concepts/goals through grammar or use of programming language to program\nsolutions.\n• A Lexicon/Dictionary is used to disambiguate the intent input or derive semantic meaning\nfrom the intent input.\nThe MEF contribution referred here gives an exemplary DSL idea for a “Skype for Business”\nservice intent.\nFor the MEF 71 intent engine scope there are initial thoughts shared through contributions\nthat indicate the presence of intent compiler that leverages Lexicon to disambiguate the input\nand a parsing logic that recognizes named entities as well as derives semantic context. The\nintent parsing logic recognizes named entities in the intent and maps it to different classes of\ninterest such as People, Locations, Organizations, and Products, etc. It further extracts\nsemantic meaning through the mapping to classes, attributes and relationships. This kind of\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 12 of 13\nIG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0\nparsing is quite similar to the natural language processing followed in modern applications.\nThe compiled intent expression is further mapped to the DSL for a specific user or specific\ndomain.\nIn the exemplar SD-WAN Service intent DSL format suggested in the MEF community, the DSL\nschema consists of the keywords to denote the start/stop of entity definition blocks, restricted\ndomain-specific keywords (such as SD-WAN Edges, Connectivity, etc.), a place holder for user\ninput (or variables), and comment blocks.\n1.2.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling\nMEF restricted DSL is simple and straightforward in its representation by defining a set of\nkeywords for a specific domain and catering to a specific set of users that can be translated or\nmapped to system-level policies. However, this simplicity needs to be examined with the\nrequirement for reusability, interoperability, and applicability across wider scenarios to avoid\nthe proliferation of multiple variations/versions of such restricted DSLs as well as specialized\nDSLs to meet specific needs. Additionally, the exemplar formats suggest leverage on a Lexicon\nof keywords, and management of such a lexicon may be an overhead unless it is handled by a\ncentralized authority globally. MEF 71 initial contributions also indicate an evolution from\nrestricted DSL to an advanced ontology and lexicon-based intent expression as well as the\nincorporation of domain-specific information model along with the ontology. In this case, an\nintent compiler is used to compose the semantic context by referring to the intent ontology\nand the input received from the consumer in restricted natural language format.\n1.3. ETSI ZSM Dynamic Service Descriptor\nETSI ZSM 005 (Means of automation) gives reference to the intent-based modeling concept as\none of the principles for the “means of automation”. The specification also refers to intelligent\norchestration as a replacement for classic orchestration which can generate prescriptions at\nruntime to figure out the appropriate system state taking into consideration the current\ncontext.\nETSI ZSM 011 (Intent driven autonomous networks; General Aspects) which is still in the early\ndraft stage has a placeholder for intent meta-model which is a possible technology-agnostic\nmeta-model that can be used for intent specification within the ZSM framework. Additionally,\nthe draft also has a placeholder for documenting the domain-specific information models that\ncan be used to specify the different intents to be used between the different entities.\nAt a high-level ZSM 005 differentiates between policies and intent – policies as concrete\nfunctions to take decisions and intent as higher-level goals and benefits, further policies\ntranslate intent into concrete network setup. It is also mentioned that intent-based modeling\nis a synonym for goal-based policy refinement, for example, CFS with certain quality or\nbehavior can be seen as a goal. The key difference with traditional orchestration is the\npresence of intent-graph - CFS object along with the behavior (policy) for composition\n(relationship) at runtime. The intelligent engine follows the policies to build CFS -> RFS ->\nResource objects.\nZSM 005 further suggests the model description needs to capture the entire semantics of the\nmodel, which in other words is called the “reason behind the model” that is used by the\nintelligent orchestrator to create prescriptions at runtime. While the format of such a model is\nnot mentioned in this specification, new terminology is coined to capture the Service model\nand the behavior aspect which may help the intelligent orchestrator to derive the runtime\nprescriptions – this is referred to as Dynamic Service Descriptor (DSD). Further, it is noted that\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 14\nIG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0\nthe behavior aspect of the service model is captured as policies. So essentially the DSD would\ncompose the Service objects, relationship graph, and behavior policies. At run-time the state\ntransition of the service objects may be governed by the behavior policies and the relationship\ngraph may influence the creation of service hierarchies. To summarize, according to ZSM 005,\nDSD forms the basis for intent wherein a graph of service objects is formed, and each service\nobject is requested by another service object and such request is made on a service object.\n1.3.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling\nZSM 005 and ZSM 011 tend to give a mixed view on the way intent is modeled. Both\nspecifications do not indicate the intent meta-model format or how this can be leveraged for\nexpressing different types of intent across domains.\nWhile ZSM005 gives a new descriptor concept (DSD) which includes packaging of\nbehavior/semantic aspect of the model to be used by the orchestrator as well as the\nrelationship, it still looks to be low-level detail that cannot be composed without specialized\noperational knowledge (especially the behavior aspect). ZSM011 is in the early draft stage and\ncurrently does not indicate a specific intent meta-modeling approach.\n1.4. ETSI Generic Autonomic Networking Architecture (GANA)\nIntent Representation and Meta-Modeling approach\nThe ETSI GANA Framework (ETSI TS 103 195-2) being a truly generic reference model for\nAutonomic Networking, Cognitive Networking and Self-Management of Networks and\nServices, accommodates any (meta)-modeling languages for Intents and does not restrict to a\nspecific language for (meta)-modeling of Intents. For the simple reason that it gets to be\ndecided at the time of GANA instantiation onto a particular reference implementation-\noriented network architecture and its associated management and control architecture, the\nframework(s) for use in (meta)-modeling of Intents in the resultant “GANA autonomics”\nenabled reference network architecture and its management and control architecture. The\nvalue of ETSI GANA is in its ubiquitous pervasive applicability to a wide range of ICT network\narchitecture scenarios and cases (the current architectures and future network architectures\nas well), being a generic blueprint based framework for implementing autonomics, cognition\nand self-management capabilities for networks and services.\nFor example, a GANA instantiation onto a Broadband Forum (BBF) network architecture\nscenario and its associated management and control architecture creates a “GANA\nautonomicity”-enabled BBF architecture scenario (see for example ETSI TR 103 473 on GANA\nonto BBF architecture scenarios, one of several GANA instantiation cases). Another example of\na GANA instantiation is the GANA instantiation onto the 3GPP Backhaul and EPC Core Network\n(ETSI TR 103 404). Other example GANA instantiations include ETSI TR 103 495, ETSI TR 626.\nWhat it means is that in all these various GANA instantiations any (meta)-modeling framework\nfor Intents supported by the target architecture upon which GANA Functional Blocks and\nReference Points have been instantiated (e.g., in the BBF architecture case or 3GPP Case, etc.)\nshould be applied.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 14 of 15\nIG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0\n1.4.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling\nTherefore, what the ETSI GANA Framework addresses rather, when it comes to Intents and\nIntent Based Networking (IBN) are the following aspects:\n1. Types of Intents: The ETSI TR 103 195-3 describes various types of Intents and where they\ncan be used in an Autonomic Network (AN), namely: (1) Vertical Downstream Intent, (2)\nVertical Upstream Intent, and (3) Horizontal Intent (Cross Domains)\n2. A Framework by which Intents are to be handled in GANA is described in ETSI TS 103 195-\n2 and complementarily in ETSI 5G PoC White Paper No.4:\nhttps://intwiki.etsi.org/images/ETSI_5G_PoC_White_Paper_No_4_v3.1.pdf\n3. How Intents and other Inputs for use in Network Governance via the Governance\nInterface of the Autonomic Network (AN), such as High Level Business Goals for the\nNetwork, Service Profiles and SLAs, Network Service Definitions/Graphs, Service\nChains/Graphs, and Profiles/Policies, are all used to generate a composite Governance\nInput called “Network Profile” that encapsulates all such items as structured and packaged\ninputs to the Autonomic Network (AN). To quote ETSI TS 103 195-2: “High Level Business\nGoals for the Network, Service Profiles and SLAs, Network Service Definitions/Graphs,\nApplication Intents and Profiles/Policies, are all used to generate a Network Profile\nconsisting of information such as technical goals/objectives of the network, network\nservice profiles, network service policies, application intents and profiles, configuration\ndata for network elements (NEs), and other types of information and data that could be\nnecessary to create or generate and store into the inventory in form of configuration files\nor model descriptions (e.g. YANG models).With the aid of a G-MBTS Translation and\nNetwork Profile Generator Tool the human operator generates Low Level Config Policies\nand Config-Data or Models consisting of Policies, Goals, Intents, Service Definitions, and\nConfiguration-Data encapsulated by a Network Profile Skeleton that may be generated in a\nformat like XML, and any additional Config-Files or Models (e.g. YANG models) required.\nThe Knowledge Plane DEs algorithms shall operate in such a way that they are governed\n(by the goals and policies) or are aware of such items encapsulated by the Network Profile\n(i.e., the DEs take into consideration the items in the Network Profile). The Network Profile\nalso contains Node Profiles for individual NEs (GANA nodes) that may be expressed in a\nformat such as XML should be complemented with Node Config Files in some formats\naccepted by NEs' configuration agents. “\n4. Roles that Ontologies could play at the Network Governance Interface of an AN: The ETSI\n5G PoC White Paper No.4 (\nhttps://intwiki.etsi.org/images/ETSI_5G_PoC_White_Paper_No_4_v3.1.pdf) discusses the\npossibility to use \"a business level language” that could help the Network Operator to\nexpress what is needed from the autonomic network, with consideration that \"such a\nbusiness language shall be semantics-oriented and may be modeled by the use of an\nontology to add semantics and enable machine reasoning on the goals\". The White Paper\nfurther mentions the need for translation of high-level ontology-based business language\nto Service Profile and Network Profile. These profiles are distributed for policy execution\nand enforcement at Network elements to network functions.\n5. Integration of Automated Management and Autonomic Management as two domains,\nand definition of Network Governance Interface through which Intents and other Inputs\ncan be used to govern the Autonomic Network (AN):\nhttps://www.etsi.org/images/files/ETSIWhitePapers/etsi_wp16_gana_Ed1_20161011.pdf\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 15 of 16\nIG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0\n1.5. ETSI ENI Intent Representation and Translation\nETSI ENI System Architecture specification ENI 005 gives reference to three types of policy –\ndeclarative policy, imperative policy, and intent policy. These policies are defined as follows:\n• Declarative policy: a type of policy that uses statements from formal logic to describe a set\nof computations that need to be done without defining how to execute those\ncomputations.\n• Imperative policy: a type of policy that uses statements to explicitly change the state of a\nset of targeted objects.\n• Intent Policy: a type of policy that uses statements from a restricted natural language (e.g.,\nan external DSL) to express the goals of the policy but does not specify how to accomplish\nthose goals.\nFurther, the ENI System Architecture specification introduces the Unified Policy Information\nModel which is based on MEF Policy Model that serves as a common language that enables\nconcepts used by different policy authors to be mapped to equivalent concepts in other levels.\nAs per this model, all types of policies are abstracted and represented in terms of policy\nstatements and each statement is represented in terms of policy clauses.\nENI gives multiple language choices for writing different types of policies:\n• Controlled Language: a restricted version of a language that has been engineered to meet\na particular purpose. Example – a restricted form of natural languages such as English\nwhich uses a subset of grammar and vocabulary.\n• Domain-Specific Language: a small human-understandable language that uses a higher\nlevel of abstraction to communicate and configure software systems for a particular\napplication domain.\n• General Purpose Language: a programming language used by professional programmers\nand developers that can address a wide variety of problems and domains.\nAs per the ENI specification, the difference between DSL and GPL is that DSL is typically\ndesigned to be used by the non-programmers that are experts in the domain which DSL is\naddressing. Additionally, DSL is classified as internal vs external wherein the internal DSL does\nnot require a specialized compiler/interpreter, whereas external DSL requires the\ndevelopment of own grammar that may require specialized compilers/interpreters. ENI\narchitecture specification recommends the use of external DSL for representing intent policies\nfor enabling non-programming users to define/use the policies. Additionally, it is\nrecommended to define standard intent grammar specifications for intent policies. It also\ncautions against using controlled natural language as it requires significant effort to develop\nand maintain.\nETSI ENI Specification ENI 008 (Intent Aware Network Automaticity) explains in detail the\nprocess of intent translation using the “intent translation” functional block as part of the Policy\nManagement. The translation is carried out because the intent policy rule for one constituency\nmay be quite different in structure and content compared to other constituencies. The intent\ntranslation functional block is expected to perform lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, semantic\nanalysis, and augmentation, either parsing or compiling and, optionally, interpretation of the\nIntent Policy. Intent translator derives meaning out of the intent and converts it into the\ndesired format executed internally by the ENI system or generates a recommendation to be\nused by assisted systems.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 16 of 17\nIG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0\nAt the time of this writing, there is a new work item “ENI 013 – Intent Policy Model Gap\nAnalysis” being initiated in the ETSI ENI workstream which is expected to evaluate different\nmethods for intent policy modeling, mostly those driven by other SDOs and also expected to\nprovide a recommendation on way forward.\n1.5.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling\nETSI ENI specifications give a comprehensive view on intent management based on the intent\npolicy, covering the variants, translation mechanism, how it may be consumed by the ENI and\nassisted systems, etc. There are also directions on representing the intent policy as an\nextension of the MEF Policy Model, however, there is a lack of clarity currently on the intent\nDSL or the meta-model based on which intent DSL will be developed. But from the details, it\nlooks like the direction is to use a restricted DSL similar to the approach followed in MEF. As\nstated above, ENI also cautions against using a controlled natural language instead of\nrestricted DSL due to the overhead in developing and maintaining such language. The\nrecommendations in ENI-013 (work in progress) may provide more clarity on how an intent\nmeta-model can be used as per the directions in the ENI specification.\n1.6. 3GPP Intent Modeling Approach\n3GPP TR 28.812 specification “Study on scenarios for Intent driven management services for\nmobile networks” describes intent-driven management concepts, scenarios, and\nrecommendations for the way forward on standardization. One of the concepts covered in this\nspecification is an intent expression which is a piece of information that includes the objective\nand related details. The specification also details the responsibility of the “intent-driven\nManagement Service Provider” to translate the intent expression information to services,\nnetwork operations, and related resource requirements.\nIn TR 28.812 a high level representation of Intent Expression is given as a combination of\n<IntentDrivenAction> and <IntentDrivenObject>. Here IntentDrivenObject gives the\nmanagement object information according to intent requirement, whereas IntentDrivenAction\nprovides abstract and simplified network and operation information according to intent\nrequirements. The IntentDrivenObject is composed of <intentDrivenObjectName> and set of\n<IntentDrivenObjectProperties>, similarly <IntentDrivenAction> may consist of the\n<IntentDrivenActionName> and set of <IntentDrivenActionProperties>.\nFurther to the intent expression concept the 3GPP specification details the intent translation\nas well as dimensions of the intent-driven framework. One of the dimensions being mentioned\nis the Language of intent, which can be:\n• Native machine language: expressed in native machine languages such as computer code\nor binary code\n• Imperative: expressed in simple statements mainly describing the “How” part than the\n“What”\n• Declarative: expressed without defining the control flow\n• Natural: expressed in human language\nFurthermore, the specification also differentiates Policy-driven management and intent-driven\nmanagement. Here, an intent is identified as the state where we want the entity to be and\npolicy as the necessary step to get to this state.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 17 of 18\nIG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0\n1.6.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling\nWhile the 3GPP 28.812 specification does not give detailed intent meta-modeling guidelines,\nthe representation of intent expression as a combination of intent object and intent action\ngives some direction expected for 3GPP specific scenarios. However, expression of intent as\nthe desired state (intent object) and abstract action on an object (intent action) gives a notion\nthat the consumer is aware of the object state and actions on an object, i.e., this is more\naligned to a restricted DSL that can be applied for specific management scenario or\ndomain. Unlike the ETSI ZSM and ENI specifications where different flavors of policy are\nexpressed (one of those being intent policy), in the 3GPP specification, the difference between\nintent-driven and policy-driven management is identified. 3GPP specification also indicates\npolicy-driven management as an evolutionary step towards intent-driven management. The\nspecification does not indicate how the action & objective in the intent expression may map to\nthe policy (to drive the management entity to the desired state).\nIn 3GPP specification 28.312 (Intent driven management services for mobile networks) which\nis still in the early stage (initiated during the Release 16 time frame), a placeholder section for\nintent categories based on management scenario types is given. This section is expected to\ngive more details on the intent expression however, this is not available yet.\n1.7. IETF Intent Classification Methodology\nIETF draft on Intent Classification (draft-irtf-nmrg-ibn-intent-classification) discusses the\nnetwork intent, methods to classify and encode intent, and intent taxonomy among other\ntopics. Additionally, RFC 7575 (Autonomic Networking: Definitions and Design Goals) defines\nintent as an abstract high-level policy used to operate a network.\nThis IETF draft on classification also identifies two key aspects to classify intents – solutions\nand actors. i.e., the intent types vary based on the specific solution that it caters to – for\nexample, Carrier Networks, DC Networks, Enterprise Networks; similarly, the intent types vary\nbased on the actor as the actor requires different intent types based on use case and context.\nThe IETF draft further gives an intent classification methodology to create new intent\nclassification from scratch and intent taxonomy (covering the intent solutions, intent user\ntypes, intent types, intent scopes, network scopes, abstractions, and lifecycle) that can be used\nalong with intent classification methodology for various solutions.\n1.7.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling\nWhile the IETF draft (draft-irtf-nmrg-ibn-intent-classification) currently does not suggest any\nmeta-modeling for intent, it gives clarity on the methodology to be used for classification of\nintent as well as helps to identify the key elements that constitute intent and considerations\nwhile preparing the intent for specific scenarios. The IETF draft highlights the need for\ndifferent types of intents catering to different use cases and contexts depending on the\nsolution or actor that it is being used with or other criteria being considered in the intent\nclassification methodology. This may help in setting a base for DSL or models of intent.\n1.8. IETF NEMO Network Intent Modeling Language\nIETF draft draft-xia-sdnrg-nemo-language (NEMO (NEtwork MOdeling) Language) describes a\ndomain-specific language based on an abstraction of network models and accommodates\nvarious operational patterns. IETF draft draft-zhou-netmod-intent-nemo describes a basic\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 18 of 19\nIG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0\nyang model for the network intent expressed through NEMO language. The yang model\nconsists of basic building blocks for expressing network intent such as node, link, flow, policy,\nand intent batch which can be extended based on the use case requirement.\nA detailed explanation of the model construct is beyond the scope of this document. The\nNEMO language is built around a set of basic network models abstracting the network demand\nand these demands can be for network resources or network behavior. The network is\ncomposed of three basic entities - Customer Facing Node, Connection, and Service Flow. To\naccommodate the network behavior expected by the end-user NEMO provides two types of\nconstructs – information acquisition and control operation. The information acquisition\nconstruct provides two methods to get information about the network – Query and\nnotification. Similarly, to control the network NEMO supports operations that can be\nassociated with any entity such as Node or Service Flow operation.\n1.8.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling\nAs noted above NEMO language has limited scope and is primarily used for an abstract\nrepresentation of network demand. The language accommodates both the object and\nbehavior part of the intent that requires a specialized intent engine to translate to the low-\nlevel constructs as well as to build the end-to-end network context based on the input. A\nreference yang model for the NEMO language is available in draft draft-zhou-netmod-intent-\nnemo which can be used as a meta-model. The model also allows the extension of basic\nbuilding blocks to accommodate user-specific objects or behaviors. As NEMO has restricted\nconstructs and limited scope it can only be treated as a restricted intent DSL for a specific layer\nand may not be relevant for wider intent meta-model requirements.\n1.9. ONAP Intent-Based Network Proof of Concept\nONAP introduced the intent-based network management capability in the Guilin Release with\nthe implementation of the IBN proof of concept (reference), which is roughly based on the\n3GPP 28.812 intent-driven management system reference architecture. The ONAP Guilin\nrelease IBN PoC showcased a vertical industry use case for smart warehouse management. The\nPoC introduces an intent framework which takes high-level business goal as input, converts it\nto necessary network configurations and applies the network changes via network automation\nand/or network orchestration. The framework also monitors the status of the network under\ncontrol, to verify that the intent is being met and takes corrective actions when desired intent is\nnot met. The intent framework consists of four functional blocks.\n• intent management: Provides a northbound interface for consumers, including intent\nschema and intent management\n• intent translation: Converts higher-level business goal to network-level configuration or\norchestration request\n• intent decision and execution: Decides which candidate intent solution shall be executed\nin response to a request by a managed entity and executes the translated intent solution\nby sending an appropriate request to a managed entity or to another intent framework.\n• intent database: Stores intent schema, intent instance, and intent knowledge\nThe ONAP IBN proof of concept uses the 3GPP recommended intent structuring format which\nat a high level consists of <IntentDrivenAction> and <IntentDrivenObject>. Refer to the 3GPP\nIntent Modeling Approach above for more details about these entities.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 20\nIG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0\n1.9.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling\nWhile the ONAP IBN proof of concept is experimental as of the Guilin Release, it gives a\nreference implementation roughly based on an SDO recommended approach. The current\nscope and applicability are limited for the particular scenario being considered. However, the\napproach being followed indicates a use case specific intent DSL to be defined and used for\nintent translation, decision, and execution. The translation mechanism is also based on simple\nlexical and grammatical analysis without any immediate scope for knowledge-based semantic\ntranslation. ONAP IBN project has defined an enhanced set of capabilities as road map items\nfor upcoming releases which includes general intent modeling as well as enhancement of data\nmodel for specific use cases.\n1.10. O-RAN\nO-RAN WG2 Specification A1 interface- General aspects and principles defines RAN intent and\ndifferent types of policy such as imperative, declarative and intent policy. The RAN intent is\ndefined as “Expression of high-level operational or business goals to be achieved by the radio\naccess network, allowing an operator to specify the desired SLAs that RAN needs to fulfill for all\nor a class of users in a given area over a period of time”. The definition of different types of\npolicies is based on ETSI GR ENI 004. While the RAN intent definition is currently out of scope it\nis expected that the Non-Real Time RAN Infrastructure Controller which is part of the Service\nManagement and Orchestration component of the O-RAN Architecture, is responsible for\nreceiving the RAN Intent and then translate to an internal policy such as over A1 interface. But\nuntil the scope of the RAN intent and the functional capabilities are clearly defined it will be\ntoo early to speculate.\n1.10.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling\nAs explained above O-RAN currently does not provide any intent meta-model specification for\nRAN intent. Only the need for the RAN intent at a system level is expressed. So, it is assumed\nthat the realization of such a RAN intent is expected to be implementation specific. From the\ndefinition of RAN intent, it is assumed that the representation of the intent is more of a\nDomain specific language limited to RAN domain which expresses the goal in terms of SLA and\nRAN needs.\n1.11.

Terms\nTerm Description\nAutonomy The capability to make decisions free from human control.\nAutonomous An Autonomous Network is a system of networks and software\nNetwork platforms that are capable of sensing its environment and adapting\nits behavior accordingly with little or no human input.\nAutonomous AN Levels describe the level of autonomic capability in a given\nNetwork Level operational workflow or for an autonomous domain (L0->L5). AN\nLevels identify contextual autonomous capability.\nControl loop Control loops are used to enable autonomous systems to adapt\ntheir behavior to respond to changes in user needs, business goals,\nor environmental conditions.\nFor full list of terms related to autonomous networks see IG1230.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 8 of 54\nIG1252 Autonomous Network Levels Evaluation Methodology v1.1.0\n2. Scope of Document\nThis document defines the Autonomous Networks Level based on TM Forum IG1218, IG1230,\nand serves as the autonomous level evaluation component of the Autonomous Network\nMaturity Model. It describes the concepts of Autonomous Networks Level, which include\nAutonomous Networks Level methodology and approach, operational processes, their\nunderlying sub-processes and tasks, task evaluation criteria etc., and finally establishes a\nstandardized evaluation approach for assessing (in an offline manner) the Autonomous\nNetworks Level of a network, or part of a network.\nNote: The current version 1.1.0 does not cover business operation layer, and it will be\nextended in the future version.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 9 of 54\nIG1252 Autonomous Network Levels Evaluation Methodology v1.1.0\n3. Background, Benefits, and Usage\n3.1. Background and benefits\nA common understanding of the levels of autonomous network will be helpful to the\ntelecommunications industry. The operator's operational and management efforts and\ndedicated human resources will vary according to different autonomous networks levels. It\nwould be beneficial for operators to have clear view on the expectation of the level of their\nnetwork (s) to indicate the maturity of the network autonomy, so that they could firstly focus\non the important features which should be prioritized to achieve a certain level of autonomy in\ntheir networks. This approach will help operators to smoothly migrate to a higher autonomy\nlevel and a better operational efficiency.\nSeveral standards development organizations (SDOs) have been trying to assess the different\nlevels of network automation across different service providers and enterprise businesses.\nHowever, the reference guidelines in systematic evolution of automation and quantized\nmeasurement methods are still unclear.\nThe clearly defined autonomous network levels in this document has the following benefits:\n• Providing guidance to operators, vendors and other participants of the\ntelecommunications industry for roadmap planning.\n• Providing reference for gap and priority analysis for future work on network\nautonomy.\n• Providing a basis for measuring the level of an autonomous network, or autonomous\nnetwork feature, along with its components and workflows.\n• Providing detailed process-oriented approach and effect-oriented metrics to achieve\nquantized evaluation.\n3.2. Usage of this document\nThe document is intended to be used by service providers and solution provider to help them\nin conducting high level autonomy assessments of their existing network and system,\nidentifying their maturity and specific areas for future improvement. The baseline process\nstructure used within the methodology may vary slightly from one operator to the next. A\nservice provider can, if required, adapt the flows or structures to suit their own environment.\nThe evaluation methodology remains fully valid, thus has broad applicability.\n© TM Forum 2021.

Autonomous network levels\nThe work done in «SAEMOTORLEV» was the original inspiration for autonomous network\nlevels. Automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions: information acquisition,\ninformation analysis, decision and action selection, action implementation. Within each of\nthese types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e.,\nfrom fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four\ntypes at different levels «MODLEVELTYPE».

General principles\nThe approach is intended to provide a pragmatic assessment of nominated \"AS-IS\" use cases\nwith the view to seeing how they can benefit from autonomous networking in the future \"TO\nBE\". The approach consists of selecting an operational use case in a given network domain and\nservices domain. For the purposes of this description this is called an \"evaluation object\". A\nprocess and task oriented decomposition is then performed on the evaluation object, using\nboth qualitative and quantitative methods, the approximate network level is derived. Note\nthat it is approximate, to aid process, component, and vendor assessment, and generally\nlonger term planning.\nFigure 5.1. Autonomous network level approach and procedure\n5.1.2. Determine the evaluation object\nThe evaluation object is a service and/or network with selected operation flow for\nautonomous network level evaluation.\nDetermine the evaluation objects based on selecting an operational use case from three-\ndimensional elements of services domain, network technology domain, and operational flows\nshown in Figure 5-2.\nFigure 5.2. Determine the evaluation object\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 54\nIG1252 Autonomous Network Levels Evaluation Methodology v1.1.0\n5.1.3. Describe operational flow of the evaluation object\nAuthenticity：This should reflect the flows of the evaluation object in an actual production\nenvironment.\nIn business/service/ resource operation layer, the operational flows include: Planning,\nDeployment, Service providing , Maintenance, and Optimization.\n5.1.4. Decompose operation flows into operation tasks\nEach production activity can be mapped to a unique, or atomic, operation task. One\nproduction activity-to-many operations task cannot exist. If one production activity is mapped\nto multiple standard operation tasks, the production activity needs to be further\ndecomposed. This decomposition should continue until it is no longer possible to further\nbreak down items.\n5.1.5. Assess autonomy at the task level\nFor each task: Assess the autonomy of the task based on the autonomy level evaluation\ncriteria. Valid scores are between 1.0 (manual operation) and 5.0 (full autonomy).\n5.1.6. Calculate the score of the evaluation object level\nCalculate the overall autonomy level for the evaluation object level by averaging the levels for\neach task. Using average aggregation is relatively balanced and objective. It can reflect the\noverall situation of the evaluation object and avoid too many human factors (such as weights)\nwhich will need to be looked at as part of more detailed measurements. A final score will be\nbetween 1.0 (manual operation) to 5.0 (full autonomy).\n5.1.7. Output the overall evaluation conclusion\nUsing the autonomy scores derived across the evaluation object, identify strengths and\nweaknesses, highlighting that tasks that require significant improvement. Based on the\nevaluation object level score calculation result and identification of strengths and weaknesses,\nan overall evaluation conclusion.\n5.2. Autonomous network (AN) operation flow\nBased on service provider perspectives and best practices, each operational layer of the\nautonomous network can be decomposed to the following operation flows:\n• End-to-end operation flows in business layer: Including customer lifecycle management\nprocesses and product/offering lifecycle management processes.\n• End-to-end operation flows in services layer: Including the flows of resource-facing\nservices planning, deployment, maintenance, optimization and inventory management .\nAlso, includes the flows of customer-facing services planning, deployment, service\nproviding, maintenance, and optimization.\n• End-to-end operation flows in resource layer: Including the processes of resource/network\nplanning, deployment, maintenance ,optimization and inventory management.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 14 of 54\nIG1252 Autonomous Network Levels Evaluation Methodology v1.1.0\nPlanning, deployment, service providing, maintenance, and optimization compose the whole\nlife cycle process of the production. Inventory management is an important foundation for\noperators in network O&M, and also a general inventory management process may be used\nand embodied in the other 5 flows. Based on the requirement of operators for the building\nand evaluation of the operation flows, the logic relation of flows is put forward as Figure 5.3\nFigure 5.3.

Operation flow and operation tasks\nControl-loops are used to describe (and execute) the necessary steps to fulfill certain\nmanagement purposes. An operation flow is an encapsulation of one or more management\ntasks that exist in the context of a control loop. The autonomy capabilities of the tasks within\nthe operation flow may impact the network autonomy level. The following are the potential\ncategorization of the tasks in an operation flow:\n• Intent/Experience: The group of tasks which translate intent from operator or customer\ninto detailed operations which may affect one or more of the following groups of tasks\n(i.e., awareness, analysis, decision, execution), also evaluate and feedback intent fulfilment\ninformation (e.g., the intent is satisfied or not).\n• Awareness: The group of tasks that monitor and understanding what happening or exists\nin quality/state of network/services, such as collecting network/services information,\npreprocess information and selective notification, etc.\n• Analysis: The group of tasks which analyze data generated in the awareness phase, use\ntechnologies (such as model inference) and analysis, make a recommendation for decision.\n• Decision: The group of tasks that decide the necessary management operation for\nexecution, e.g., network configuration or adjustment.\n• Execution: The group of tasks which execute the management operations and feedback\nthe result to the intent requester.\nFor example, the relationship between tasks and AI-based cognitive workflow in monitoring\nand troubleshooting operation process is as follows:\n• A task group of fault management policies generation and fault management intent\nfulfillment evaluation constitutes intent.\n• A task group of fault impact analyze, and display, fault identification, and risk prediction\nconstitutes awareness.\n• A task group of fault demarcation fault root cause location and fault recovery solution\ngeneration constitutes analysis.\n• A task of fault recovery solution selection constitutes decision.\n• A task of fault recovery solution implementation group of solution implementation and\nverification constitutes execution.\nThe principles for decomposing operation flow to operation task are as follows:\n• Completeness: All the O&M must be included in the operation tasks.\n• Balance: The sizing and granularity of each task is relatively balanced.\n• Non-Overlapping: The operation task is atomic and does not have functional overlaps with\nother tasks.\n© TM Forum 2021.

Task evaluation criteria\nOnce all tasks are defined each one must be evaluated for autonomy. A key criterion for\ndetermining the intelligence level of each task in L0 to L5 is to consider what agents are\nperforming the task：\n• Human: The task is completed by human, and no system assistance capability is available.\n• System assists human: The task is jointly completed by human and system. The main\noperations are completed by person and a few actions are automatically completed by the\nsystem.\n• Human assists system: The task is jointly completed by human and system. The main\noperations are automatically completed by system and a few actions are completed by\nhuman.\n• System: The task is automatically completed by system. No human intervention is\nrequired.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 37 of 54\nIG1252 Autonomous Network Levels Evaluation Methodology v1.1.0\n6. Autonomous Network Level Evaluation\nExample\n6.1. Use case - wireless domain fault management to support\nmobile B2C services\nTo describe and demonstrate autonomous network levels, and the evaluation methodology,\nthis section selects the wireless network fault management operation flows within China\nUnicom that support mobile B2C services. The fault management process is one of the most\ncritical processes in a service providers network O&M. A fault management operation flow\nthat has a high level of autonomy can yield the following benefits:\n• Reduce the workload of personnel.\n• Lower the overall skill and competence requirements for O&M personnel\n• Reduce the overall time to resolution of incidents, thereby improving end-user experience.\n6.2. Evaluation worked example\n6.2.1. Approach\nBased on the methodology set out in this document, the AN level evaluation procedure is as\nfollows, and shown in Figure 6-1:\n1. Determine the evaluation object\n2. Describe operation flows of the evaluation object\n3. Decompose operation flows to operation task\n4. Assess the autonomy level of each operation task\n5.

In the cross-domain scenario,\ndemarcate the fault to a specific technical domain. In\nthe single-domain scenario, demarcate the fault to a\nspecific NE.\nTask G: Fault root cause Based on the fault demarcation result, further locate\nlocation the specific software and hardware causes (such as\nconfigurations, boards, and optical modules) of the\nfault to support the generation of rectification\nsolutions and rectify services as soon as possible.\nTask H: Fault Based on the fault demarcation and locating results,\nrecovery solution generation generate several alternative recovery/recovery\nsolutions, such as modifying configurations, restarting\nNEs, replacing boards, and isolating NEs.\nTask I: Fault recovery solution Comprehensively evaluate the alternative repair\nselection solution (such as whether the solution can solve the\nfault, whether the repair cost is acceptable, and\nwhether the extra impact on the network) and\nprovide the optimal solution.\nTask J: Fault recovery solution Rectify faults and eliminate potential risks based on\nimplementation the optimal solution. For example, deliver\nconfigurations to the network for software faults,\nisolate NEs or links for hardware faults, or replace or\nremove boards or optical modules onsite.\n© TM Forum 2021.

Overview\nThis guide describes a reference architecture for Autonomous Networks (AN) that can be used to\nprovide guidance on the development of solution architectures for intelligent automation and\nautonomy within CSP operations. It is not an implementation architecture and as such does not\nreference specific technologies. This reference architecture builds on the more technical\narchitecture IG1230, which describes the general concepts and principles behind autonomous\nnetworks [IG1230]. This guide prescribes the precise AN Framework scope underpinning the\nprinciples, the end-to-end requirements of such an industry reference architecture. The reference\narchitecture provides recommended structures and integrations of autonomous platforms,\nservices, and domains to form a mature AN solution. The reference architecture embodies\naccepted industry best practices (from TM Forum and other SDOs) and recommends the intent\nand control loop mechanisms for self-management capabilities.\n1.1 Guide Structure\nTable 1 Guide Structure\n# Section Description\n1 Overview Describes the scope and terminology used within the AN Reference\nArchitecture.\nThe scope of this doc describes the reference architecture for AN\nFramework and for the Autonomous Domains that may comprise an\nentire Autonomous Network.\n2 Architectural Architecture principles define the underlying general rules and guidelines\nPrinciples for the use the reference architecture.\n3 Architecture A holistic look at the different needs of users that the Reference\nRequirements Architecture must address from a purely architectural point of view.\nArchitecture requirements are derived from the scenarios and\nrequirements described in IG1218 and IG1230 and define nonfunctional\nas well as functional needs that are to be satisfied by the architecture.\n4 Reference Defines a set of architectural ‘building blocks’ that form the self-\nArchitecture management capabilities underpinning autonomous platforms and\nsystems.

Autonomous\nNetwork Levels identify contextual autonomous capability. Also less formally\nreferred to as ‘autonomy levels.\nControl loop Control loops are used to enable autonomous systems to adapt their behavior\nto respond to changes in user needs, business goals, or environmental\nconditions.\nIntent Intent is the formal specification of all expectations including requirements,\ngoals, and constraints given to a technical system.\nAutonomous Serves as the basic unit that can fulfill closed-loop automation of specific\nDomain network operations. An autonomous domain is a set of systems or platforms\nthat is capable of intervention. The autonomous domain does this by realizing\nself-management capabilities using a closed control loop mechanism, using\nfour key phases: awareness, analysis, decision-making autonomous behavior\n(e.g., resolve tasks, adhere to objectives) without manual human, and\nexecution. An autonomous domain is a logical construct that provides an\nadministrative governance boundary that defines the scope of the encapsulated\nautonomous behavior.\nAutonomous An autonomous platform is a system or agent with the ability to complete a task\nPlatform without human intervention, using behaviors resulting from the interaction of\nsoftware with the external environment. Tasks or functions executed by a\nplatform or distributed between a platform and other parts of the system, may\nbe performed using a variety of behaviors, which may include reasoning and\nproblem identification. In this guide the term ‘Platform’ is preferred over ‘system’\nnotwithstanding the latter’s ubiquity. The ‘platform’ term is not used in the\nsoftware architecture sense of the term where a platform provides a\nfoundational set of software services for a product.\nTable 2 above lists the key terms using the AN technical architecture guide as source [IG1230].\n© TM Forum 2022.

They reflect a level of consensus\namong the various elements of the enterprise and form the basis for making future decisions.\nThe overall design objective of autonomous networks is to enable end-to-end autonomous\nnetwork operations for telecom services, including business operations, service operations, and\nresource operations, in a multi-domain, multi-vendor environment. This section defines a set of\narchitectural principles (see Figure 2-1) to guide the autonomous networks reference\narchitecture. These principles guide the design of the system capabilities required to achieve the\ndesired autonomy levels within autonomous domains and autonomous networks.\n01: Decoupled 02: Intent-driven, 03: Closed Loop\noperations layers for open Automation\noperational flexibility interfaces\n04: Endogenous 05: Single-Domain 06: Cross-Domain 07: Supports\nIntelligence Autonomous Collaboration interactions between\nAutonomous Domains\nof different Autonomy\nLevels\nFigure 2-1 Architectural Principles\n2.2 Core Architectural Principles\n2.2.1 Principle 01: Decoupled Operational Layers supporting Operational\nFlexibility\nThe overall architecture should comply with the layered architecture pattern, the autonomous\nnetworks architecture is separated into three layers, business operations layer, service\noperations layer, and resource operations layer. Each layer runs in self-operating mode and\nhides the details of domain implementation, operations and the functions within the domain to the\nconsumers.\n2.2.2 Principle 02: Intent-driven, Open Interfaces\nEach autonomous domain (at any of the three operational layers) of Autonomous Networks\nshould expose standardized interfaces. Where appropriate those interfaces should now be intent-\ndriven to provide simplified interaction capabilities for upper-layer services through these open\nAPIs.\n© TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 12 of 36\nIG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1.0.1\n2.2.3 Principle 03: Closed Loop Automation\nAutomation uses closed loop mechanisms to assure service experience by completing workflow\nsteps but also continuously adapting to ensure goals and objectives are met. The control loop\nadjusts and adapts itself (through the decision cycle sages of Awareness, Analysis, Decision,\nExecution [IG1230]), keeping the system in the desired state without any intervention from\noutside of a particular loop cycle.\n2.3.4 Principle 04: Endogenous Intelligence\nLocal knowledge, or endogenous (“from within”) intelligence, applied locally is a core principle for\nthe internal models of autonomous domains and network elements. More real-time sensing\ncomponents and AI inference capabilities are introduced to both autonomous domains and\nnetwork elements to improve observability or digital awareness of resources, services, and\nsurrounding environments. This in turn, enables data sources to have edge intelligence\ncapabilities such as perception analysis and decision execution more locally. For example, AI\nmodels could be trained on the cloud and injected into the network through cloud-based\ncollaboration to implement local inference.\n2.3.5 Principle 05: Single Domain Autonomy\nThe autonomy and independence of a domain is a core principle of AN., i.e., each individual or\nsingle domain is itself an autonomous domain. It is the independence and self-governing\ncapability of a domain that gives the AN architecture its Lego block appearance. The\nautonomous domain is an atomic unit with autonomous capabilities in the autonomous network\narchitecture [IG1230]. Individual autonomous domains focus on network technologies, abstract\nnetwork capabilities, and simplify OSS integration.\n2.3.6 Principle 06: Cross Domain Collaboration\nIn the AN framework, each domain is autonomous, but domains must also collaborate in the\nfollowing aspects:\ni. end-to-end services need to be coordinated between autonomous domains. In the\nreference architecture practice, administrative domains may have a hierarchical structure,\nand cross-domain service management may manage end-to-end services across multiple\nautonomous domains, and coordinate between administrative domains through\norchestration.\nii. domains may federate with neighbors, allow upper layer domain only dispatch intent\nbased request without elaborate details which could be coordinated between lower\ndomains by themselves.\niii. aggregation of resource domains may happen for administrative or management purpose.\nThe administrator may merge part of the operations of several domains in a converged\nspot, arrange unified planning, operation tasks, etc.\n© TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 36\nIG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1.0.1\n2.3.7 Principle 07: Supports interactions between Autonomous Domains of\ndifferent Autonomy Levels\nAutonomous Domains of different levels have different network autonomy capabilities and\ncorresponding interfaces, the interactions between domains of different levels should be allowed\nfrom architecture perspective, and so is the evolution (L0 to L5) of each domain. The ‘runtime’\nwithin domains is always dynamic as situations and requirements change during operations, so\nthe autonomy levels supported may also change depending on the capability or competence of\nthe autonomous domain.\n© TM Forum 2022.

Page 14 of 36\nIG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1.0.1\n3 Architecture Requirements\n3.1 Introduction\nThis section defines requirements applicable to the autonomous networks reference architecture\nframework. Architecture requirements are derived from the scenarios and requirements\ndescribed in TM Forum IG1230 and IG1230A.\n3.2 General Requirements\nThe following architectural requirements inform the level of detail and scope that a reference\narchitecture for AN requires. As such, the specific constraints or goals of the architecture are\narticulated in the form of requirement objectives ( see tables 4 and 5 below).\nTable 4 General Architectural Requirements\nReq# Requirement\n[ARC-001] The autonomous networks reference architecture shall separate the system into\nthree layers, business operations layer, service operations layer, and network\noperations layer.\n[ARC-002] The autonomous networks reference architecture shall support four closed\ncontrol loops, business operations layer closed control loops, service operations\nlayer closed control loops, and network operations layer closed control loops,\nand end to end closed control loops.\n[ARC-003] The autonomous networks reference architecture shall support the hierarchical\nautonomous domain.\n[ARC-004] Each architecture layer should have its own AI capabilities.\n[ARC-005] No waste - intelligent use of basic resources. The world is essentially a closed\nsystem regarding resources, and thus their usage should be minimized, and\nthey should be recycled for sustainability.\nIn short, the goals of AN are to affect the ‘top and bottom lines’ of an operator, namely, to enable\nsimplification and achieve operator opex cost reduction while at the same time providing a\nsignificantly better service ‘fit’ for end-consumers of AN and thereby increase operator revenues.\nThe architectural requirements in Table 4 list the former, i.e., operational requirements while\nTable 5 below lists the latter, i.e., the end-customer experience requirements of the vertical\necosystem.\n© TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 15 of 36\nIG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1.0.1\nTable 5 AN Consumer Requirements\n[ANC-001] Autonomous Networks should include customer-facing Interfaces. Expose\ninterfaces (APIs) to customers, allowing them to control services at a much lower\ncost\n[ANC-002] Autonomous Networks service capabilities should be Self-Service where\ncustomer has direct control of services. Services autonomously adapt to\ncustomer intent. Customers can adapt services themselves, without sending\norders / tickets / or having phone calls. This also applies to Partnering in\noperations themselves. This allows multiple autonomous domains and platforms\nto work together to deliver overall business operations.\n[ANC-003] Autonomous Networks should provide the ability to have ‘On-demand’ delivery –\nthat is where services when required, can be flexibly scaled-up or scaled-down.\nServices can be autonomously turned on and off as needed.\n[ANC-004] Autonomous Networks should expose customized end-user Services. Services\ndelivering the correct mix of features for the specific vertical use case\n[ANC-005] Ecosystem offerings: Autonomous Networks should provide CSPs need\nbusiness platforms that can facilitate better interworking with ecosystem partners\nto deliver packaged offerings to the ‘Vertical Consumer’ or ‘AN Consumers’.\n[ANC-006] The ease of consumption and integration into end-customers’ business must be\na requirement for an autonomous network and for the touchpoints within the\nbusiness operations layer. See Service ‘Consumability’ in IG1229 Guiding\nPrinciples for more on this term.\n[ANC-007] The Autonomous Network should include the ability to operate with external\nregulation\n3.3 Autonomous Domain Requirements\nTable 6 Autonomous Domain Requirements\nReq# Requirement\n[DOM- The autonomous domain should support operation in an independent and self-\n001] operating mode.\n[DOM- The autonomous domain should support Intent-driven API, hides internal\n002] functions and implementation details, and providing intent verification and\nreporting capabilities.\n[DOM- Autonomous Domains should be able to operate in ‘Isolation’ mode when other\n003] systems are not resilient to failure\n[DOM- Autonomous Domains should be designed for uncertainty or unexpected\n004] situations. Decision-making is still required in scenarios that are unforeseen.\n[DOM- Autonomous Domains should be clear on what levels of autonomy are\n005] supported, what capabilities are supported and in what situations.\n[DOM- The knowledge base used by Local Intelligence in an Autonomous Domain\n006] should be deployed locally.\n[DOM- Autonomous Domains can be either atomic or composite. Atomic here refers to\n007] its ability to operate internally as an independent functional block. Composite\ndomains are the result of coupling particular domains together to form a\nfunctional composite where there are dependencies on the contained domains\nwithin the composite.\n© TM Forum 2022.

Page 17 of 36\nIG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1.0.1\n4 AN Reference Architecture\n4.1 Architecture Overview\n4.1.1 Introduction\nThis section defines the reference architecture for Autonomous Networks as\ni. a capability-based layered architecture\nii. that is project, market and vendor-agnostic, and does not prescribe any specific tools or\ntechnologies\niii. an architecture that enables modular and incremental implementations\nThe autonomous networks reference architecture is based on the layered-architecture design\npattern. Functional blocks within the layered architecture are organized into three operational\nlayers. The layers are decoupled and evolved independently and interact with each other through\nprescribed reference points that detail the logical communications required between two layers.\nFor the subsystem architecture of each layer, a service-based architecture is used to support\narchitecture flexibility and scalability. The autonomous networks architecture defines a group of\nlogical building blocks, called autonomous domains that construct the overall logical architecture\nof the autonomous network. This service-based architecture provides the requisite modularity of\nthe framework using autonomous domains where domains can be deployed from a variety of\nsources and suppliers. Domains can be interconnected using interfaces defined at the relevant\nreference points.\n4.2 Reference Architecture\n4.2.1 AN Reference Architecture Diagram\nFigure 4-1 depicts the TMF AN Reference Architecture that describes a layered yet ‘composable’\nframework for autonomous operations. It emphasizes and echoes all of core architectural\nprinciples outlined in Chapter 2. Operational layers are fully decoupled (Reference points\nI1,I2,I3). Open interfaces are used at all integration points between domains with intent-driven\ninterfaces being recommended at I and F reference points. Intelligence is also layered and\ndistributed closest to the ‘doer’ the functional block that executes an action, i.e., Intelligence is\ndecentralized and localized within its own domain. This is the approach that best suits fast1\ndecision-making adaptive control loops. Autonomy is maintained within these logical units of\nmanagement, namely Autonomous Domains. Complexity is encapsulated with these constructs\nto compartmentalize the capabilities so that the AN can be assembled from multiple federated\ndomains horizontally and vertically.\n1 What ETSI GANA terms ‘fast control loops’\n© TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 18 of 36\nIG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1.0.1\nFigure 4-1 AN Reference Architecture\nNote that Figure 4-1Error! Reference source not found. shows domains at a single layer for\nsimplicity but these building blocks repeat at all three layers. Autonomous Domain C is shown as\nan exploded view of the autonomous domain, illustrating some of the inner functions that\ncomprise a domain. Domain C and Domain B and Domain A all cooperate in a federated manner\n(using F3 in the figure above) but federation applies to all three operational layers. The Service\nOperations layer achieves a cross-domain collaboration of the Domains A, B, C to provide end-\nto-end coordination of all of those resource operation domains. The blue dashed rectangle for\nAutonomous Domain C (Detailed) shows the mechanisms and functions that embody an\nAutonomous Domain.\n1. Operational Layers are a logical construct that organizes platforms along three distinct\nhorizontal axes namely Business, Service, and Resource Operations.\n2. Autonomous Domains are also a logical construct that group particular platforms2 into a\ncoherent domain of autonomy. We call these platforms autonomous platforms.\n3. An Operational Layer can encompass the operations provided by multiple autonomous\nplatforms.\n4. An Autonomous Domain can comprise of multiple autonomous platforms.\n5. An Autonomous Domain can comprise of autonomous platforms from multiple operational\nlayers.\n4.3 Autonomous Domain\n4.3.1 Autonomous Domain Definition\nAn Autonomous Domain is an operational management domain that defines the scope of\nencapsulated autonomous behavior [IG1230]. It is the ‘building block’ (i.e., unit) of autonomous\n2 ** Platform and Domain are specific terms in TM Forum described in TR255. The semantics of these\nterms have been respected in the ANF definitions.\n© TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 36\nIG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1.0.1\nbehavior that when federated together form a complete Autonomous Network. It serves as the\nbasic unit that can fulfill closed-loop automation of specific network operations. An autonomous\ndomain is a set of systems or platforms that is capable of intervention. The autonomous domain\ndoes this by realizing self-management capabilities using closed control loop mechanisms, using\nfour key phases: awareness, analysis, decision-making autonomous behavior (e.g., resolve\ntasks, adhere to objectives) without manual human, and execution. An autonomous domain is a\nlogical construct that provides an administrative governance boundary that defines the scope of\nthe encapsulated autonomous behavior.\n4.3.2 Autonomous Domains Building Blocks\nThe dashed red and blue rectangular boxes in Figure 4-2 illustrate how ADs can be assembled to\nform a hierarchy of platforms using Intent-driven interactions at the vertical (governance) and\nhorizontal (federation) levels. Note that the I1, I2, I3 reference points are ‘reused’ for\ncommunication between two different domains but the reference point is still specific to the\noperational layer. For example, if you take the scenario of two ADs at the business operations\nlayer, then both ADs are federated using the I1 reference point as I1 is specific to business\noperations. Similarly, I2 is for service operation interfaces and I3 for resource operations\ninterfaces. The next section describes the federation of domains in more detail.\nFigure 4-2 Autonomous Domains Building Blocks within the Reference Architecture\n© TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 20 of 36\nIG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1.0.1\n4.3.3 Composite Autonomous Domains\nAutonomous Domains can be either atomic or composite (see Figure 4-3). As stated in an earlier\nsection on Autonomous Domain Requirements, ‘Atomic’ here refers to its ability to operate\ninternally as an independent functional block. Composite domains are the result of coupling\nparticular domains together to form a functional composite where there are dependencies on the\ncontained domains within the composite.\nFigure 4-3 Autonomous Domains are composable\n1. Autonomous Domains (AD) have well-defined boundaries (dashed3 rectangles).\n2. Domains may be atomic (AD1) or composite4 (AD5) (i.e., composed of two or more AD’s)\n3. An Autonomous Domain can support multiple “layers” of the Autonomous network (e.g.,\nAD6)\n4. An entire Autonomous Network could therefore be bounded as a single Autonomous\nDomain (e.g., AD7)\n4.3.4 Federated Autonomous Domains\nThe previous sections emphasize that Autonomous Domains are decoupled vertically (top-to-\nbottom) using I1, I2, I3 reference points and also how these domains can be federated\n(horizontally) using the same reference points. Error! Reference source not found. shows that\nthe same interfaces are used to realize both the layer decoupling and the federation, i.e., the\n“vertical” and “horizontal” interactions of Autonomous Domains. That is, the same interfaces are\nreused at the I and F Reference Points.\n3 Any dashed or dotted line or shape in ANF means that the construct is logical and conceptual rather than\na physical construct.\n4 Refer to IG1230 Section 5.2.1 Autonomous Domain is a composite structure.\n© TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 21 of 36\nIG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1.0.1\nFigure 4-4 Domains can be Federated using same Intent Interfaces at I and F Reference Points\nFor completeness, the figure below shows the same approach but for all three operational layers.\nFigure 4-5 Domains can be federated at all operational layers\nFederation of domains means autonomous collaboration of platforms across multiple self-\ngoverning domains. A federation is a peer-to-peer relationship between two or more parties\ninvolved in order to achieve a common goal [FED]. For example, in a resource operations layer,\nmultiple ADs may be interfaced in a layered, peering, or orthogonal way to combine operational\ncontexts and promote a virtualization of an autonomous network over the physical infrastructure.\nThe benefit of this flexible network architecture is that it scales over time and in a functional way;\nthat is, the network and its operations can extend both horizontally as well as vertically and\nchange over time. This architecture is functionally adaptive and scalable and is the basis for an\nevolving network that incorporates various self-X capabilities such as self-optimization, self-\nhealing, and self-protection [IG1218]. These self-X capabilities are realized in individual control\nloop mechanisms defined within domains and across domains.\n© TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 22 of 36\nIG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1.0.1\n4.4 Functional Blocks\nThe overall architecture is composed of a set of functional blocks defines across the three\noperational layers and the framework. The functional blocks realize the behavior required to\nrealize initially Autonomous Domains as ‘building blocks’ and secondly the other blocks required\nby platforms to create a coherent reference architecture. The most fundamental abstraction used\nis the nested, composable nature of domains that when chained together or assembled form an\nautonomous network.\n4.4.1 AN Consumer\nAN Consumer Platforms are the systems where the end-customer interacts with the autonomous\nnetwork(s). AN Consumer platforms comprise of:\n1. CSP Consumers Services (B2C)\n2. CSP Services to Enterprises (B2B)\n3. CSP Services to Enterprises’ Customers (B2B2X)\n4.

We term this platform\n“Knowledge and Intelligence” within the reference architecture. This platform is responsible for\naggregating and federating data sources from the operational layers, generating AI/ML models\nand supporting cross-domain automation with end-to-end insights, predictions, and\nrecommendations.\n‘Knowledge and Intelligence’ provides both human and machine intelligence and analytics\nservices to the AN operational layers.\n© TM Forum 2022.

Three of the reference points identify the interactions between the three operational\nlayers of the AN framework, namely business, service, and resource operations. These reference\npoints are vertical in orientation and are termed I1, I2, and I3. Domains within the operational\nlayers can all communicate in a horizontal orientation to achieve a federation, and these are\ntermed F1, F2, and F3. And finally, three reference points in a horizontal orientation connect the\noperational layers to a Knowledge and Intelligence platform. These are termed K1, K2, and K3.\nTable 10 AN Reference Points\nReference Description\nPoint\nI1 identifies the reference point for interactions between AN Consumers\nplatform and the Business Operations layer.

These interfaces or APIs will become control points\nbetween two platforms (system) as an implementation of the functional blocks.\nTable 11 Interface at Reference Points\nInterface Reference TM Forum Payloads\nPoint Reference\nIntent I1,I2,I3 TMF921 Intent Expression is passed in the\nManagement F1,F2,F3 (Planning stage) interface message body (payload) in\nAPI Suite\n© TM Forum 2022.

The TM Forum AN\nProject team working with the AIOps Initiative team and the TM Forum’s API, and AI project\nteams will collaborate to build out a map of the required interfaces at these reference points.\n4.5.2 Intent-driven Interfaces\nOperations automation is needed to support the fast deployment requirements of the 5G new\nservices. Operators will need to be more efficient to offer the best possible user experience, with\nfull lifecycle automation of the network and maximum utilization of the network resources. The\nnetworks’ automation relies on an automated closed loop driven by the provided intent. As such,\nclosed loop automation needs to be in each operational layer including the network elements\n(managed entities) at the resource operations layer, and the cross-domain service operations\nlayer to achieve the goal of network autonomy.\nCross-domain collaborative closed loops and single-domain autonomous closed loops coordinate\nand exchange information with each other by open interfaces. To reduce the integration\ncomplexity between the layers, the AN reference architecture requires a simplified open interface\nbetween the platforms at the lower layer and its upper layer consumer platforms. The information\nexchanged through these interfaces will change from the current data-centric and parameter-\nheavy payloads to an exchange of intents (see [1230] and [IG1253]. The simplification of the\nopen interfaces, in turn, relies on autonomous network capability in each autonomous domain\nregardless of what operational layer the domain encompasses.\nA key capability of intent-driven autonomous systems is to infer the intent of the user, rather than\nrequire the end-user to provide detailed instructions. These systems should be able to adapt to\nthe needs of the user and understand their language and learn how to interact with users. An\nintent interface may be an API with an explicit “grammar” for intents (other synonyms demands,\nrequirements, expectations, objectives). It may also use a “dialog” style of interaction, i.e., a\nconversational API with intelligent ‘back-and-forth’ between the owners and handlers of the\nintent. The nature of this dialog could use an “interview” style interface in which the handling\nsystem requests additional information from the user as needed, to provide clarifications, to\nprovide alternatives, to recommend changes to intent (“Intent Negotiation”).\nThe I1,I2,I3 reference points include many different communication styles, some traditional\nmechanisms but also new intent-driven interactions. TMF921 Intent Management API Suite will\nprovide a set of interfaces to support Intent-driven interactions.\n© TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved.

These SDOs have positioned the TM Forum Autonomous\nNetworks architecture as the top-level architecture for reference and instantiation. The ETSI ZSM\ngroup was formed with the goal to accelerate the definition of the end-to-end service\nmanagement architecture, spanning both legacy and virtualized network infrastructure, to enable\nautomatic execution of operational processes and tasks.\nZSM instantiates the services and resource operations layer of autonomous networks\narchitecture as shown in Figure 5-1.\nFigure 5-1 ETSI ZSM Architecture as the realization of AN RA\nThe E2E Service Management Domains contain management functions and management\nservices that align to the autonomous platforms of TM Forum’s AN Frameworks Service\nOperations layer.

Intent-driven interactions at the I1, I2, I3 reference points drive the\nclosed control loops within the layers which are informed by localized knowledge with the AN\nFramework.\nThe detailed flows within the intent management function and the control loop management\nfunctions are omitted for clarity and brevity. The important messages are 1, 4 and 7 where\nmessage cross the operational layer boundaries.\nFigure 6-1 E2E Intent-driven Autonomous Network\nNote that the three Intent interactions (see messages 1, 4, and 7 above) are realized by the\nforthcoming TMF921 API specification.\n© TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 29 of 36\nIG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1.0.1\n6.2 Example of Call Flows between Autonomous Domains\nThe figure below shows an example of the message flows between the autonomous domains of\nthe reference architecture. Intent-driven interactions at the I1, I2, I3 reference points connect the\nautonomous domains and create the integration fabric.\nMany variants of the intent negotiation flow exist and beyond the scope of this guide but\ndescribed in the Intent in Autonomous Networks guides [IG1253]. One variant is where message\n6) below is sent to the third Intent Management function and it then communicates with Intent\nManagement in fourth AD. Here the Intent Management of the third and fourth Autonomous\nDomain federate the domains together and each ‘resource operations’ domain negotiates with\nthe other and then communicates to the cross domain service AD.\nFigure 6-2 AN Reference Architecture Call Flows (Multiple ADs within single layer)\nThe following section details the main interactions between the functional blocks within the\noverall reference architecture. A ‘thin slice’ is examined in the form of the I1,I2,I3 reference points\nthat go from the consumer to network element and back. As such this set of interactions\ndescribes the outer customer loop from the AN framework itself.\nThe procedure, as illustrated in Figure 6-3 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture\nIllustrated (UML Sequence), consists of the following steps:\n© TM Forum 2022. All Rights Reserved. Page 30 of 36\nIG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1.0.1\nBusiness Intent\n1. AN Consumer sends a Business Intent to Intent Management (IM) function at the\nBusiness Operations layer\n2. The Intent Management function requests contextual knowledge based on part of the\nintent expression content.\n3. The Intent Management function handles the intent request by translating the Intent\nExpression into a directive for a Control Loop Management (CLM) system.\n4. The CLM starts at the analysis stage by determining affected contextual data\nrequirements and mines contextual data from the knowledge base.\na. Details of the workflow loop connection creation, interactions with the knowledge\nbase, and health checks are omitted.\n5. The decision stage then compares characteristics of results with policies and constraints\ndefined for that capability\n6. The execute stage sends actions to the managed entity in this layer.\n7. An awareness step that monitors the outcome of the action taken completes and the CLM\nreports back on the outcome\n8. The Intent Management function decides to issue a newly generated intent southbound\nand sends it to a downstream intent management function of the service operations layer\n(I2)\nService Intent\n9. Steps 10 to 16 are similar to the above steps 2 to 8\n17. The Intent Management function sends a resource intent to the Intent Management\nfunction defined for an autonomous domain at the resource layer.\nResource Intent\n18. (Steps 18 to 22) The CLM of the Resource Operations layers executes the AADE loop\nmechanism as steps 2 to 8 above\n23. The CLM executes an action on the Network Element (NE)\n24. (optionally) Site Intelligence at the Network Element is performed.\n25. Data collected from the NE is provided as part fo Awareness stage of control loop\n26. Awareness stage is completed and the Intent reporting phase begins\n27. The CLM functions responds to the IM function , and\n28. The IM sends a intent report to its ‘owner’ intent caller.\n29. This IM at the service operations layers also reports to its ‘owner’ Busines Intent caller\n30. The IM at the business operations layer then reports on teh Intent based on what was the\noutcome was at the service layer.\nNote 1: The Awareness, Analysis, Decision-making, Execution (AADE) control loop pattern\ndefined in IG1230 is based on the well-known MAPE-K pattern. For clarity, the individual\ncomponents and the messages between the four stages are not shown as individual actors in the\nUML sequence diagrams. Rather, the generalized steps of AADE are shown as part of the CLM\nlifecycle.\nNote 2: Many more illustrative UML sequence flows across AN are possible, such as more\ndetailed call flows detailing the use of F reference point interaction to federate domains together,\nas well as call flows showing the use of K reference points from the local domains to the\n© TM Forum 2022.

All Rights Reserved. Page 32 of 36\nIG1251 Autonomous Networks Reference Architecture v1.0.1\n7 Summary\nAutonomous does not mean “unmanned”. Humans are still needed in the operations of\nAutonomous Networks. However, humans are now ‘on the loop’ operational supervisors rather\nthan ‘in the loop’ bottlenecks to automation. Humans are good at providing input to systems –\nmuch like a teacher to a student – this is where expert knowledge will be accumulated over time\nto build human intelligence into autonomous platforms. As more and more systems take on\ncomplex tasks autonomously, we can still rely on humans to be there for the tasks that the\nsystem cannot handle – this will work to also build the necessary trust we need in autonomous\noperations in Autonomous Networks.\nThis guide introduces the AN Reference Architecture and provides realization scenarios\ninstantiating the architecture as described. The architecture is defined at a functional level with\nthe identification of external reference points.\nThree classes of reference points are defined, these are:\nI interactions between operational layers\nF interactions between autonomous domains within layers\nK interactions between automation domains at a given layer and a knowledge and\nintelligence platform\nThe important interfaces required at each reference point have been defined, with\nstandardization work on intent-driven interfaces and AI closed loop management already\nunderway. A complete implementation of the reference architecture is not simply achieved in\none project or iteration but rather can be achieved step-by-step - starting with a single domain\nat a time and then building cross-domain coordination until you ultimately achieve a full\nAutonomous Network.\nThe Autonomous Network will be intent-driven, context-aware, and guided by\nknowledge and intelligence. Autonomous Domains provide the modular\nbuilding blocks for CSPs to assemble these hierarchical self-governing\nnetworks.\nThe development of Self-X capabilities within domains will be expedited by the use of standard\nreference points/interfaces and standard data models. Hierarchical and programmable closed\nloop automation architectures with distributed decision-making elements will allow for faster\nand more accurate automated operations. Federation will allow cross-domain sharing of\ninformation among decision elements that will provide better insights on the end-to-end customer\nexperience. More work is planned within the TM Forum to identify and further develop the\ninterface specifications at all the reference points that comprise the AN reference architecture.\nReal-world CSP uses cases will make use of multiple autonomous domains across the\noperational layers. AI-enabled software and traditional software will coexist with human\noperations. The ability to have both single-domain autonomy and cross-domain collaboration will\nbe essential to providing autonomous closed loop management of complex networks and\nservices.\n© TM Forum 2022.

Overview\nAs described in Clause 1 of IG1218 [1], the basic method of defining AN is to use a user centric,\ntop-to-down, business driven and quick-reiterative approach to develop all contents of\nAutonomous Networks, which case studies serve as the inputs to generalize the common\nbusiness requirements, framework, key capabilities and lifecycle of operations.\nThe case studies are categorized as follows:\n• Operations efficiency improvement. Mainly focuses on the automation and\nintelligence of existing network services and operations, e.g., network planning &\ndesign, deployment, maintenance and optimization, which could be based on\nspecific issues or E2E processes of telecom infrastructure.\n• Business revenue enablement. Mainly focuses on the enablement of innovative\nservices and agile operations of business growth, e.g., Autonomous ICT\nservices/infrastructure and operations for verticals.\nThe case studies highlight the key issues that are related to AN, i.e., the automation and\nintelligence of operations, in particular, depicts the key capabilities per different levels of\nAutonomous Networks.\n© TM Forum 2021.

If the network cannot achieve the benchmark KPIs or SLAs (service level\nagreements), or enable good user experience, it must be adjusted to meet or exceed those\nrequirements.\nThis is the function of network performance improvement or optimization.\nThe complete process of network performance improvement or optimization includes several\nstages:\n• network monitoring and evaluation\n• root cause analysis of performance problems\n• optimization analysis and optimization decision-making\n• optimization implementation\n• post- evaluation and verification\n2) Autonomous level\nLevel 2: Drive test evaluation is not required for coverage optimization.

This makes the network very dynamic and complex.\nThat complexity is further increased by the diversity of services and of terminal performance, and\nby the mobility of users. There are thousands of radio feature parameters (e.g., Massive MIMO\npattern) with broad value ranges affect each other and combination reaches millions. In addition,\nthe configuration of radio feature parameters values depend on various wireless scenario and\ndiversified wireless services, the initial radio network feature parameters may not always meet\nthe requirement and the adjustment effort needs to take consideration of interference control,\nhuge parameters combination and frequent traffic change under diverse scenarios. So, it is\nbeneficial to use AI technology to achieve the optimal radio features parameters combination\nautomatically to deliver the best coverage and capacity for the complex wireless environment.\nThe Multi-vendor area based wireless network deployment scenarios is the typical 5G network\ndeployment scenario, where the operator’s network is composed of several subnetworks and\neach subnetwork contains multiple NG-RAN Nodes from same vendor which cover different\ncertain areas. The coordination of wireless network optimization for different areas also is the\nkey challenge to achieve the optimal performance for the whole wireless network.\nComplexity of wireless network\nThe multi-vendor OSS and different RAN Domain Managers work together with each other for\nthe wireless network optimization to achieve the optimal coverage and capacity for the whole\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 14\nIG1218A Autonomous Networks – Case studies\nwireless network in a coordinated manner. The multi-vendor OSS is responsible for generating\nand dynamically adjusting the wireless network requirements and coordination policies for\ndifferent RAN Domain managers by predicting the trend of service performance (e.g., traffic)\nchange. RAN Domain manager is responsible for the wireless network optimization for the NG-\nRAN nodes in certain area, which includes automatically identifying network issue and selecting\nthe best radio feature parameters pattern based on online iteration optimization. In addition, the\noptimal radio feature parameters pattern combination is generated by fast predicting the gain\nvalue to achieve the scenario-adaptive and traffic-adaptive wireless network optimization.\nAN capabilities of Wireless Network Optimization can be evolved into five levels:\n L1: system assist human to improve the efficiency for wireless network optimization action\nexecution and wireless network performance awareness.\n L2: system additionally analyses the wireless network performance and identify the network\nissue based on the network issue rules specified by human.\n L3: system additionally analyses the optimization solution and determine the adjustment\nactions to be executed based on wireless network requirements and optimization policies\nspecified by human\n L4: system additionally determine and update wireless network optimization policies and\nrequirements dynamically based on service assurance intent.\n L5: system achieve the full autonomy for wireless network optimization for full scenarios and\nservices\nCase 2: AI based 4G/5G intelligent assurance management\nWith the acceleration of 5G, 4G/5G collaborative networks are becoming more complex. On\naverage, more than 500,000 transmission alarms are generated from the entire network of a\nprovince every day, it is inefficient to handle them based on specialists ‘experience. Trouble\ntickets are dispatched based on alarms, redundant and inaccurate trouble tickets may be\ndispatched; the root cause information of faults is not accurate, and the root causes of numerous\nfaults are not provided. This affects onsite troubleshooting efficiency and prolongs the fault\nrecovery time.\nAutomatically analyzes faults from the massive chaotic transmission alarms, recommends fault\nhandling priority according to the network layer of the faults which affects the service.\nAutomatically inferences failure unit according to “failure scene snapshot” and AIOps algorithm,\nthen distributes incident tickets by OSS.\n\"AI, Big data and Fault domain algorithm\" can be used to transform traditional alarm monitoring\nto intelligent fault O&M. Automatically analyzes 500,000 alarms per day and provides accurate\nfault location. The number of tickets decreases by 35% as tickets are dispatched based on\nincidents instead of alarms.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 14 of 15\nIG1218A Autonomous Networks – Case studies\n4G/5G intelligent assurance management\nAN capabilities of the 4G/5G intelligent assurance management can be evolved into five levels:\n L1： Manually monitored tool-assisted network alarms. Manually analyze the root cause\nand recover network.\n L2： The monitoring rules are manually designed and automatically monitored. Manual\noperation + system analyze the root cause and recover network.\n L3：Manually designs monitoring rules, automatically monitors the network, manual and\nthe system predict network deterioration, automatically analyzes root causes, automatically\ngenerates recovery solutions, and manually recovers network.\n L4：Manual input of intents, automatic intent conversion to monitoring rules, automatic\nmonitoring, automatic network deterioration prediction, automatic root cause analysis,\nautomatic generation of recovery solutions, automatic decision-making, and automatic\nrecovery execution.\nCase 3: Intelligent energy O&M of Data center\nWith the rapid growth of data volume, data centres tend to be large or super-large. A large\nnumber of dumb devices or components are not digitalized, require a large amount of manpower\nfor onsite meter reading and collection. Manual Inspection，7*24hours attendance，6 to 12\nonsite inspections per day, the proportion of manpower cost continues to rise. As a result,\nOutdated O&M methods result in low efficiency and high O&M costs. Reliability is facing\nincreasing challenges and risks, potential system risks cannot be identified in advance, and the\nSLA cannot be guaranteed.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 15 of 16\nIG1218A Autonomous Networks – Case studies\nThe automatic inspection technology automatically collects device data and device status\ninformation that is not digitized through image recognition and voice recognition. The full\ndigitization of devices is automatically detected in the following modes: Data collected by the\ntraditional monitor system; Device panel status identification. Identify potential device faults:\nIdentifies and analyses abnormal audio features of devices, Real-time noise reduction, feature\nextraction, and exception identification. Automatic inspection is implemented to greatly improve\ninspection efficiency, and further improve the reliability and availability of data centre\ninfrastructure and reducing O&M costs.\nAutomatic Maintenance for Data center Facility\nAN capabilities of Intelligent energy O&M of Data center can be evolved into five levels:\n L1 (Tool-assisted operation): Tool-assisted monitor network status, operator can handle the\nnetwork fault manually.\n L2 (Partial Autonomous Networks): system automatic executes system faults recovery\naction, basically eliminating the need for recovery manually.\n L3 (Conditional Autonomous Networks): system automatic intelligently identify problems\nthat occur during device running and predict the health status of devices and detect\nproblems, basically eliminating the need for manual awareness\n L4 (High Autonomous Networks): system automatic root cause analysis, automatic\ngeneration of recovery solutions, automatic decision-making, basically eliminating the need\nfor manual analysis and determine\n L5 (Full Autonomous Networks): All-scenario automation, completely autonomous operation\nand automatic recovery of system faults\nCase 4: Provide intelligent maintenance to reduce complaints for HBB domain\nThe HBB Maintenance faces many problems, such as a large number of user complaints and\nmany site visits for fault rectification. As a result, the O&M cost remains high. A CSP with about 2\nmillion users handles about 15,000 user complaints every month. Most faults are handled\nmanually and about 70% faults need to be handled on site. HBB Intelligence Maintenance can\nreduce user complaints and site visits effectively.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 16 of 17\nIG1218A Autonomous Networks – Case studies\nHome Broadband Intelligent O&M Service Scope\nNetwork-based complaints rising generally go through 3 phases as above. Based on the service\nlayer, HBB O&M is divided into three case studies: Proactive Faults Prediction and Prevention,\nMassive fault interception, and Network fault intelligent diagnosis.\nAN capabilities of the HBB intelligent O&M can be evolved into five levels:\n• L1 : Tool-assisted monitor network status, and troubleshooting, recovery. Events process\nautomation rate is low.\n• L2 : The system automatically detects port-level exception events, the system assists in root\ncause location, and automatically dispatches FMEs to rectify hardware faults onsite. Events\nprocess automation rate is medium.\n• L3 : The system automatically detects service-level exception events. Automatically locates\nroot causes, and recovery the software/configuration faults. The system automatically\nforecasts user compliant risks. Events process automation rate is high.\n• L4 : The system automatically detects exception events in real time. The system\nautomatically identifies root cause location, forecasts user compliant risks and makes\ndecisions. Events process automation rate is very high.\n• L5 : All-scenario automation(Events process automation rate is 100%.), with the same\ncapability requirements as L4.\nCase 5： Intelligent home network management to meet Bandwidth Experience Commitments\nMajority of users' complaints are caused by the issues of home networking and home network\nequipment. As the traditional home network is unmanageable, resulting in long failure recovery\ncycle, high OPEX, and low user satisfaction. Therefore, operators need a more intelligent\nmanagement system to create better broadband experience, reduce OPEX, analyze new\nrequirements for the home intelligence networking and introduce new services opportunity.\nThe home network intelligent O&M solution can meet the requirements: Make the home\nnetwork more visible, CSP easily monitor the status and indicators of the network continuously,\nand can determine whether the network is fault; Automatically identify the relationship of the\nuser experience and indicators, find out the root cause of the network fault or poor experience,\nprovide recommended solutions, and help operators to quickly and remotely troubleshooting;\nAutomatically configure the device when root cause is related to some configuration, and\n© TM Forum 2021.

All Rights Reserved. Page 18 of 19\nIG1218A Autonomous Networks – Case studies\nAN capabilities of the Intelligent home network management can be evolved into five levels:\n L1: Tool-assisted monitor network Topo and network status, operator can handle the\nnetwork fault manually.\n L2: Continuously monitoring the home network, CSP can analyze the root cause manually\nand automatic recovery execution.\n L3: Automatic perception of abnormal status of home network, automatic identification of\nissues, and CSP can analyze the root cause manually.\n L4: Automatic root cause analysis, automatic generation of recovery solutions, automatic\ndecision-making, and automatic recovery execution\n L5: All-scenario automation, with the same capability requirements as L4\nCase 6: 5G Core Network Intelligent Operation and Maintenance\nThe core network plays an important role in the carrier network. A small potential risk or fault\nmay cause service interruption or service quality deterioration on the entire network. After\nvirtualized infrastructure and software-based network elements (NEs) are introduced to the 5G\ncore network (5GC), network assurance involves the cooperation of multiple systems, such as\nvirtual network functions (VNFs), physical devices, and virtualization software. This further\nincreases the difficulty in predicting and preventing network risks and demarcating and locating\nfaults. How to detect and prevent network risks, quickly demarcate and locate root causes of\nfaults, and resolve problems before customer complaints without increasing O&M personnel and\nO&M costs is an urgent issue for telecom operators before large-scale 5G commercial use.\nThe Huawei 5GC intelligent O&M solution combines rich communication technology (CT) and\ninformation technology (IT) O&M analysis experience with artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and\nautomation technologies. AI is used for model training, AI inference, intent insight, and intelligent\nanalysis to mine log data, detect abnormal key performance indicators (KPIs), implement\nmachine-assisted network change detection, and diagnose Network Functions Virtualization\n(NFV) cross-layer faults. In this way, core network faults and potential risks can be detected in\nadvance and quickly demarcated and located. Moreover, performance monitoring, fault\ndetection, and fault prevention can be implemented in routine maintenance and change\nscenarios of the core network, helping ensure normal running of the network and services.\n Log analysis: Based on O&M analysis experience, the AI and big data technologies are used\nto explore potential device risks in logs as a supplement to alarm events. In addition,\nmultiple data sources such as logs and alarms are associated for intelligent analysis to detect\nnetwork cloud faults and potential risks in advance and quickly demarcate and locate the\nfaults.\n KPI anomaly prevention and prediction and machine-assisted network change detection: AI\nmodeling and online detection are used to monitor NE KPIs in real time in various scenarios\nsuch as routine maintenance, key event assurance, and network change. In the early phase\nof a fault, exceptions are identified and reported in a timely manner, shortening the fault\ndetection time. The accuracy of exception identification reaches 85%.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 20\nIG1218A Autonomous Networks – Case studies\n NFV cross-layer fault diagnosis: The system comprehensively analyzes fault information,\nsuch as NE alarms, configurations, KPIs, and logs, in the space and time dimensions in the\ncross-layer topology to form a rule workflow for diagnosing faults. This helps automatically\nanalyze and demarcate NFV cross-layer problems and shortens the cross-layer problem\nhandling duration.\nFigure: 5GC intelligent O&M system\nThe Autonomous Network Levels of the 5GC intelligent O&M are described as below.\n L1: assisted management . The system monitors the network running status in real time,\nreports alarms in a timely manner, and helps demarcate and locate faults, rectify faults, and\nrestore services based on expert experience.\n L2: partially autonomous network. Static rule/policy based, Execution automation. In some\nfault scenarios, single-layer faults of a single NE are visualized, and exceptions of KPIs based\non static thresholds are visualized and alarms are reported. Users use tools or the system to\nlocate faults, and the system provides recovery suggestions to help users formulate recovery\nsolutions.\n L3: conditionally autonomous network. Dynamic rule/policy based, Analysis automation. AI\nis preliminarily involved. The preset model of the system automatically identifies faults and\nreport’s fault events based on multidimensional data (alarms, KPIs, logs, and user records) in\nthe space and time dimensions, and automatically demarcates faults based on preset fault\nscenarios to help formulate recovery solutions.\n L4: highly autonomous network. Intent driver, Closed-loop control, Decision automation. On\nthe basis of L3, expert experience and AI are efficiently collaborated. The system\nautomatically identifies service impacts and fault severity and reports them. The system\npresets repair templates or rules to implement fault self-healing in limited scenarios.\n L5: fully autonomous network. 5GC-related network risks and faults are automatically\npredicted, prevented, and rectified.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 20 of 21\nIG1218A Autonomous Networks – Case studies\nBenefits of 5GC Intelligent O&M\n Intelligent identification of potential risks: NFV logs are used to analyze network risks 15\nminutes in advance, reducing the fault rate by 5%. Compared with the traditional\nmethod, KPI anomaly prevention and detection can identify 30% of core network\nservice faults and network exceptions caused by NE configuration changes in advance\nand help quickly demarcate faults.\n Quick fault rectification: Typical faults are automatically diagnosed within 15 minutes.\nThe time for locating the root cause of a network fault is reduced by 30%, and the Mean\nTime to Repair (MTTR) of major interruption faults is shortened by 35%.\nCase 7: Intelligent batch 5G base station out of service detection and isolation\nWith the further expansion of the 4G/5G hybrid network scale, manual fault locating is often\nrequired when a sudden fault occurs. Because multiple technologies can be involved (e.g., IP,\nfiber, microwave, etc.), fault locating is difficult and time-consuming. Therefore, the intelligent\nroot cause locating function needs to be added to help the monitoring front office to analyze and\nlocate the fault root causes. This feature implements refined management of out-of-service faults\nof wireless base stations, distinguishes different fault causes, effectively detects unexpected\nfaults, and enhances the management of out-of-service faults and incidents of wireless base\nstations.\nTo address existing challenges, the intelligent preprocessing of 5G base stations out of service in\nbatches solution constructs autonomous capabilities in three scenarios:\n• Intelligently mine alarm correlations with AI to implement intelligent identification of multi-\nvendor cross-domain faults and incidents.\n• Automatic diagnosis of multi-vendor faults and incidents based on expert experience\n• In-depth analysis of batch out-of-service faults and incidents through all-domain lossless\ninformation collection and association analysis\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 21 of 22\nIG1218A Autonomous Networks – Case studies\nBusiness Value:\nThe intelligent preprocessing solution provided to the customer for 5G base station out-of-service\nin batches improves network autonomy, greatly improves maintenance efficiency, reduces a\nlarge number of invalid work orders, and improves the overall network quality. For example, in a\nproject of a carrier in China:\n• The customer's AN level score is improved from 1.5 to 2.8 according to the AN level\nmethodology outlined in [1].\n• The MTTR is reduced by 10% to 20%.\n• Invalid work orders are reduced by more than 20%.\n• The troubleshooting efficiency of maintenance personnel is improved in both front office\n(by 80%) and back office (by 25%)\nClassification characteristics of L1-L5\nThe 5G batch base station out-of-service autonomous capability can be classified into the\nfollowing five levels:\n Level 1: Assisted management: EMS assist to monitor 5G base station out-of-service alarms\nbased on pre-configured monitoring rules, identify batch 5G base station out-of-service fault\nand incident, demarcate and locate root causes based on expert experience such as\nconnectivity tests, and restore services manually.\n Level 2: Partially autonomous networks: Based on static rules, the system automatically\nenriches and standardizes alarms from different vendors, correlates cross-domain faults,\nlocates faults and incidents via analyzing alarms and executing commands, and the system\ncan automatically dispatch trouble tickets when 5G base station status are abnormal base on\npre-configured trouble ticket dispatching rules.\n Level 3: Conditional autonomous network: The system support dynamic\nextension/adjustment on rules via self-learning 5G base station fault model. Based on that,\nthe system provide 5G base station out-of-service faults and incidents identification.

Case studies of business revenue enablement\n3.1 Autonomous Networks hyperloops for enabling Smart-X industries\nThe advent of 5G is pushing CSPs to rethink their business models and to come up with new designs\nand deployment strategies to cater for vertical specific enterprise case studies. 5G adds the\ncapacity and latency to support a wider range of case studies, device types and network\narchitectures (edge, virtualization, network slicing, SD/NFV, SD-WAN, AI/ML), but it also comes\nwith its own set of challenges such as increased network complexities and management issues. To\naddress these challenges, CSPs need to rapidly adopt a new end-to-end architecture which is\ncontrolled and managed autonomously.\nAutonomous Networks with zero wait, zero touch and zero trouble capabilities are needed to\nsupport the diverse set of vertical use case requirements. Once Autonomous Networks are in place,\nB2B companies like smart cities and service providers, B2C customers, digital service providers and\ntelecom service providers will benefit from enhanced quality of seamless experience and improved\noperational efficiency. In addition, the end-to-end life cycle complexity will be hidden behind the\nscenes and experience assurance will in inbuilt. The new Autonomous Networks framework\nenables greater agility and provides best practices for much faster launch of new services and\nsolutions\n.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved.

This AD supports different types of\ndevices (e.g., IoT, AR/VR, AP/STB/mobile)\n• Autonomous domain 2 (AD2) – Edge/access network. This AD supports the RO\nwith real time processing and localization required for agents of connectivity,\nresource control, orchestration, data analytics and applications\n• Autonomous domain 3 (AD3) – Cloud. This AD supports BO and SO for\nmanagement and control, Intelligence & governance, as well as applications.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 24 of 25\nIG1218A Autonomous Networks – Case studies\nshowing the high-level solution architecture for Autonomous Networks\nThe project illustrates a full life cycle of Autonomous Networks solutions and its requirements for\ndynamic business processes and models by leveraging cutting edge technologies like 5G, edge, AI,\nand virtualization.\nThe project aims to implement, verify and illustrates the key capabilities of Self-X (e.g., self-\nordering, self-fulfilling and self-serving) in a full lifecycle of user/business/service/resource closed\nloops of Autonomous Networks solutions. It is based on business intent to resource intent\ninteraction, which is a requirement for dynamic business processes and models. It is achieved by\nleveraging cutting edge technologies like 5G, Edge Computing, AI, and virtualization. The detailed\ninformation of the solution can be found in the Catalyst Project Whitepaper – ANHL [4]i.\nThe interacting closed loops to ensure full end-to-end lifecycle operation and management, as\nfollows:\n1. Business Closed Loop:\n1a) Business Request: the user described their \"Business Intent\" (application attributes, SLA and\nkey characteristics of AN services) to the “Business Operations (BO)” system in AD3 that requests\nAN services (e.g., xxx) for smart education.\n1b) Business Fulfillment: the BO translates the business intent into Service Intention (e.g.,\nconnectivity, availability, security, and quality of experience) and send as Service Intent requests.\n1c) Business Close Loop lifecycle management: The BO continuously guarantees that the Business\nintent is delivered and takes care of changes, if allowed, down to the termination.\n2. Service Closed Loop:\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 25 of 26\nIG1218A Autonomous Networks – Case studies\n2a) Service Request: the SO in AD3 translates the Service Intent into Resource Intent (Resource\n(bandwidth, computing/storage) and QoS (latency, jitter, packet loss)) according to the\nrequirements of each RO.\n2b) Service Fulfillment: the SO will interact and instruct “Resource Operation (RO)” in AD2 to\ndeploy all required applications and orchestrate, manage, and monitor their resources.\n2c) Service Close Loop lifecycle management: The SO continuously guarantees that the Service\nintent is delivered end to end by the different RO and takes care of the service changes, if\nallowed, down to service termination.\n3. Resource Closed Loop:\n3a) Resource Request/fulfillment: The RO of AD2 manages its resources to meet the needs of\neach service.\n3b) Resource Fulfillment: The AD2 also transfers and processes applicable data flow in the edge\nnode in real time.\n3c) Resource Close Loop lifecycle management: Each RO continuously guarantees that the\nResource intents are delivered by each AD and takes care of automatic reconfiguration of the\nnetwork and IT resources (self-healing, self-optimizing) down to the releasing of the resources.\n4. User closed loop with assurance:\n4a) User closed loop is supported through streamlining the above 3 closed loops, not only for\nservice delivery but for service assurance as follow.\n4b) Each Autonomous Domain monitors abnormal events (e.g., performance and fault events, or\nsecurity attacks), and alerts other affected Autonomous Domains. Each affected Autonomous\nDomain collaborates to figure out the solution and informs the BO and SO in AD3 when the\nsolution is implemented, and the problem is resolved. The SO may be involved in managing and\norchestrating cross-autonomous domain events in real time.\n3c) User Close Loop lifecycle management. The BO, SO and RO are also in charge of the\nmonitoring of the activity of the close loops (evaluation of the results of execution)\nThe mapping of Autonomous Levels:\n● Level 2: one or multiple Self-X capabilities supported in one of the steps of one lifecycle of\nbusiness, service or resource closed loops e.g., self-ordering, self-organizing or self-healing.\n● Level 3: one or multiple Self-X capabilities supported in one or multiple full lifecycles of\nbusiness, service or resource closed loops e.g., self-serving, self-fulfilling or self-assuring if\napplicable.\n● Level 4: All Self-X capabilities supported in one or multiple full lifecycles of business, service\nor resource closed loops e.g., self-serving, self-fulfilling or self-assuring if applicable.\n● Level 5: all Self-X capabilities supported in the full lifecycle of all closed loops\n3.2 Autonomous Networks operations automation for vertical industries\nCase 1: 5G slicing for enabling Smart Power Grid\nThe electric power industry raises requirements for high bandwidth, reliability, low latency, and\nlarge-capacity machine communication to communications networks.

The search for an objective methodology to map and realize value needs a\ncomplete view of value definition to value realization in order to arrive at robust and\nrealistic economic returns of investments. All leading enterprises are making record-\nbreaking investments in digital transformation due to mounting pressure to quickly\nbring technology-enabled products and services to market, and achieve efficiencies at\nscale, however the ability to showcase the real value is still a concern.\nIdentifying initiatives for Investment and effectively attaching the right success criteria\nare both critical for the promise of digital transformation. The need to radically\ntransform enterprise operations in order to compete effectively and efficiently has\nbecome pivotal in defining digital strategies. The practice of measuring investment\nreturns for digital transformation projects, programs and use cases is still not applied\nsystematically, and where there are forms of measures in place, the approach to\nascertain validity and direct alignment to business value are at best indirect or\nvague. EY reports three out of five companies don’t know how much they spend on\ndigital operating or capital expenditures, or what value it yielded in incremental\nrevenues, reduced cost and working capital.\nThe need for a framework and methodology to provide a systematic approach to digital\ncapital allocation with the right governance in place is therefore an important step for\nTM Forum members. The need to have clear guidelines and principles for capital\nallocation to the many business and technology initiatives in the industry requires\nalignment of strategy goals and technology goals to deliver return on investment and\ndirect impact on the business. With the industrial upgrade and the change of business\nmodels, all service providers look to digital transformation strategies to meet existing\nand new business objectives. The need for alignment between technology, operations\nand business targets are sometimes elusive, or at best ephemeral. From capital\nbudgeting to enterprise performance management, the need to effectively align\ninvestments to improved top-line business outcomes is core to the managing for\ninvestments. CEOs and CFOs want to identify relevant metrics that embody the\ntechnology, operations and business outcomes in an integrated framework and\nmethodology. As CSPs look to strategies and techniques for zero-touch and improved\ntechnology self-management, the journey to operations dexterity with little or no human\ninvolvement needs to be measured and managed.\nTM Forum members have defined the “Measuring and Managing autonomy” in the\nwhitepaper around a framework, and a methodology to focus on high-levels of\nautonomous operations' outcome. Justifying investments with well-defined value\nmodels seeds a success-framework that can enable validate implementation and\nimpact of investments on businesses initiatives. TM Forum MAMA provides a way to\nsystematically solve the problem of programming, measuring and managing\ninvestments for outcomes. It defines a set of components around which autonomous\ninitiatives projects can be based. While it is defined under the autonomous operations\ninitiative, it is a generic framework applicable and extendable to any other enterprise\nstrategic initiative. It defines modular components to support the journey of defining\nand building strategic technology initiatives, as well as offering a platform upon which\nautonomous operations initiative derive concrete answers for business problems\n© TM Forum 2023.

Background\nWhat matters and is of core relevance to any organization and its business should be\nmeasurable. To measure is to drive performance. As the saying goes “What doesn’t\nget measured, doesn’t get managed.” To be able to measure and manage autonomy, it\nis important to define metrics and performance indicators that allow understanding,\ntracking, and managing the relationship between “cause and effect” in alignment to the\nbusiness value it accrues to an organization. Industry upgrades require companies to\nrethink how to measure the performance of their business. Companies who are\npursuing digital transformation strategies recognize that new strategies and\ncompetitiveness demand new measurement and strategic management “systems”.\nThus, a clear business objective or strategy that fails to have clear measures fails to\ndrive a clear impact on organization performance. This means you cannot effectively\nand efficiently manage what is not measured.\nOrganizations recognize the need to build capabilities for autonomous operations. TM\nForum AI-Closed Loop Automation, Anomaly Management, Intent Management, and\nAutonomous Networks etc., projects are defining and developing the technical\ncapabilities to realize new technologies and systems, but it is challenge in the midst of\nmany enterprises digital transformation initiatives to trace specific attribution of value\nreturned to an investment for the business. This challenge to measure the value of\nautonomous operations technical initiatives and the impact on business outcome in the\nlong term has led to the definition and development of MAMA.\nAs increased automation focuses on priming business value, “hyperautomation”, a\nbusiness driven, disciplined approach that organizations use to rapidly identify, vet and\nautomate as many business and technology processes as possible, is a trend. It is\ntherefore a key boardroom topic to Identify, qualify and execute “hyperautomation”\nstrategies like AI-Closed Loop Automation, Autonomous Networks initiatives and many\ndigital transformation strategies by bringing the right value measurement and business\nmanagement tools and approach to match the business needs and aspirations, and\nmarket opportunities. This requires clarity of what is expected vs. what to do.\nHyperautomation has an equally massive role in business operations. In areas like\ncustomer service, it helps automate activities that help customer support\nrepresentatives to focus on much higher and complex business functions. Customer\nsupport representatives delegate complex and time-consuming tasks to automated\nagents, while leveraging customer data to improve future interactions. By bringing\nautomation and autonomy together, we expect to leverage the value of both to\neffectively deliver unique business value. This guidebook focuses on how to realize\nvalue from automation and autonomy altogether.\n1.2. Origins of MAMA\nMeasuring And Managing Autonomy (MAMA) has origins in the TM Forum\nAutonomous Operations theme. The framework is defined by members of TM Forum to\nsupport enable measure and manage business motivations for increased automation,\nand ultimately to realize autonomy at all levels of management and operations. TM\nForum represents and provides frameworks and architecture for ICT providers and\nconsumers to improve automation and the value it brings to members. With members\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 8 of 32\nGB1040 MAMA Framework Guidebook v1.0.0\ndefining different architectures, various solutions and new common standards, TM\nForum members seek a similar view from a business management point of view in\norder to enable match the technical implementation artifacts (Open Digital Architecture,\nOpen APIs, Intent Managers, OD Components etc.) with business motivation\noutcomes.\nGartner identifies three business value pillars for comprehensive hyperautomation as\ncost savings from technology-driven labor arbitrage, efficiency through business\noperations' automation, and agility by way of fusing business models. New concepts\naround hyperautomation continue to emerge to boast business value proposition of\ndigital transformation but managing and measuring the underlying initiatives and\nprograms to effectively align the promise of value to project is still a challenge, at best\nfleeting. Also, there are challenges with hyperautomation initiatives in that it is very\nfragmented, with approaches to automation with use of technologies being far from\nstandardized. Businesses are integrating varieties of automation initiatives to\nessentially build their solution. Autonomous Operations initiative brings a set of digital\ntransformation projects to deliver higher levels of automation and autonomy.\nMAMA framework is a value assurance model by TM Forum for the industry based on\na common and integrated structure and business principles to defining goals of digital\ntransformation initiatives, particularly focused on autonomous operations initiatives. Its\norigins are founded on providing effective measures for digital transformation\ninitiatives, and ensure they are managed in a model defined as an architecture to\nbusiness continuum (ABC). It does this by:\n• Enabling collaboration based on an industry-led value-driven approach to\nautonomous operations, thus bringing together various expertise from\nmembers, to develop common goals and delivery best practices.\n• Coordinating across different TM Forum projects and with other standards\norganizations SDOs and foster creating value-orientated standards.\n• Collectively, as an industry, defining value propositions based on value\nstream(s) spanning autonomous operations stakeholders’ point of view.\n• Developing new proposals on value models that support the value\nquantification and prioritization of autonomous operations initiatives – AI-CLA,\nIntent Management, Autonomous Networks, AIOps etc.\n• Maintaining a framework and toolkit for evaluating and benchmarking the\nmaturity level of autonomous operations at capability level to guide\ntransformation planning.\n1.3. Purpose\nThe MAMA framework provides a closed-loop methodology to define, measure and\nmanage autonomous operation projects in a systemic fashion. It provides an interlink of\nfive key modules that altogether measure and manage architecture to business\ncontinuum. It includes guidelines for autonomous operation project teams, especially\nbusiness and system architects that are looking to drive their projects from business-\nvalue perspectives, and equally align and communicate with project sponsors and\nsenior executives.\nAutonomous Operations in the automation spectrum requires a complex mix of\nadvanced technologies in combination with organizational and process changes. Key\nenablers come from a broad range of AI techniques including machine learning as well\nas machine reasoning algorithms. Realizing these enablers requires a holistic view of\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 9 of 32\nGB1040 MAMA Framework Guidebook v1.0.0\nthe investment needed to materialize value attribution from these enablers. This means\nbusiness understanding of autonomy and automation in order to build the loop between\nintention and actual performance.\nThe framework helps to define clear strategic objectives and intents of autonomous\noperations (AO) initiatives, this @ includes business capabilities required to support the\nrealization of value throughout the entire customer journey, the value perceived for\ncustomers and stakeholders by measuring related business outcomes and operational\nmetrics, the gaps on business capabilities and values with the autonomous operation\nmaturity model and benchmarking.\n1.4. Users\nMAMA framework has ingredients to guide on decision-making across leadership\nfunctions in the organization (CSP)\n• For Chief Executive Officers (CEO), Chief Financial Officers (CFO) and related\nstakeholders committed to investment returns to enterprise boards, the MAMA\nframework level 1 view provides that top-level unified structure, that enable\nidentify and make accountable the key \"moving parts\" of the organization that\nadd clear value contribution to the organizations' success.\n• For Chief Operations Officers (COO) and related stakeholders committed to\ninternal business capabilities, and are responsible for day-to-day management\nand operation, MAMA framework enables harness internal drive for efficient\nand effective actions. For these stakeholders, achieving optimal productivity\nwith every input into a value stage in the value stream is critical. The framework\nprovides to these COOs and their stakeholder the capability to perform\ncontinuous business health check of the \"enterprise architecture\" and its\nunderpinning architectures - business architecture, information systems\narchitecture, technology architecture and operating models altogether.\n• For Chief Commercial Officers (CCO) and related stakeholders committed to\nmarket success, the need to reflect internal efficiencies and effectiveness into\nconcrete market and segment value propositions to customers and with\npartners is key. MAMA framework offers a map to showcase additional\nadvantage of autonomous operations, providing paths to be commercially\nelastic and scalable to meet all market engagements at every touchpoint. This\nimplies possessing a proactive understanding of customer needs ahead of time.\nThey can represent the compelling value propositions stemmed from\ninvestments using MAMA framework to help match the promise of autonomous\noperations initiatives.\n1.5. Goal\n• Establish the critical success factors for Zero-touch Operations and associated\nprojects such as Autonomous Network, AI-ClosedLoop Automation etc.\n• Position Experience-driven Operations as an anchor point to better User\nExperience and Values\n• Accentuate the bigger picture beyond a view on technology alone, such as Up-\nskilling management and operations personnel\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 10 of 32\nGB1040 MAMA Framework Guidebook v1.0.0\n• Collaboratively identify ways to increase the business value of that new\nlandscape of management and operations\n• Collectively invest in the foundational capabilities required to move towards\nexperience-driven zero touch operations.\n1.6. Key Terminology\n• Autonomy\nThe state of quality of being self-governing with the capability to adapt to\ncircumstances.\n• Automation\nIn this guidebook, automation, is the implementation of processes to perform\nactivities towards a goal without human assistance.\n• Autonomous Operations\nThis is generally referring to operations that are self-governing and adaptive to\ntheir environment without human intervention.\nBeyond self-driving networks and autonomic technology systems, there are the\npeople and processes that altogether realize the enterprise operations.\nAutonomous Operations in TM Forum is an initiative to identify, scope out and\nestablish use of AI and related technologies to improve automation towards\nautonomy.\nThe term defines concepts and solutions that enable operations to act to their\nenvironment in a tactile way meeting needs specific to their operating mandate.\n• Business Architecture\nA holistic representation of the multidimensional business views of capabilities,\nend-to-end value delivery, information, and organizational structure; and the\nrelationships among these business views and strategies, products, policies,\ninitiatives, and stakeholders.\n• Business Capability\nAs defined here, business capability comprises the people, processes,\nresources and/or information that are enabling actualization of specific\nobjectives of goals.\n• Decision Filter\nA series of processes to identify the best questions that help decision-making.\n• Capital Efficiency\nAn indicator of how well investment expenditure impact on operations and\ngrowth.\n• Hyperautomation\nThis defines the amount of earnings for every amount invested. The profitability\nindex presents the value of future cash flows expected from an initiative over\nthe initial project investment.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 11 of 32\nGB1040 MAMA Framework Guidebook v1.0.0\n• Investment Capital\na.k.a. Capital Investment - This defines investments on acquiring capital assets\nfor use in furthering long-term business goals and objectives\n• Model\nThis defines the efficiency of profit earned as a function of operating costs.\n• Value Fabric\nA value fabric is a mesh of interwoven, cooperating organizations and\nindividuals, called parties, who directly or indirectly deliver value to customers.\n(Source TM Forum)\n• Value Chain\nValue chain is a special category of a left-to-right process model, usually\ndescribed through a set of chevrons, where each chevron represents a rolled-\nup set of activities that an organization does. It is an organizational decision\nsupport tool.\nMichael Porter, in his 1985 book, “Competitive Advantage: Creating and\nSustaining Superior Performance”, first introduced the concept of Value Chain\nframework. Porter posited that an organization creates value for its customer\nthrough a set of strategically relevant activities, those of which when seen from\nleft to right (below) looks like a chain where value-addition to the organization\nand its stakeholders increases from left to right. According to Porter, a firm\nderives its competitive advantage from strategic choices it makes in one or\nmore of its value chain activities.\n• Value Stream\nA Value Stream is a visual process tool to describe a set of activities within the\norganization that adds value.\nA value stream establishes the chronological flow of goods or services or\ninformation that adds value cumulatively.\n• Value Network\nThe collection of upstream suppliers, downstream channels to market, and\nancillary providers that support a common business model within an industry.\nWhen would-be disruptors enter into existing value networks, they must adapt\ntheir business models to conform to the value network and therefore fail at\ndisruption because they become co-opted. (Clayton Magleby Christensen, from\nthe theory of \"disruptive innovation\")\nA value network refers to a series of interactions between individuals,\norganizations, or departments that benefit the entire group.\n© TM Forum 2023.

MAMA Framework\nThe MAMA framework establishes six foundational components, namely Autonomous\nOperations Strategic Initiatives, Value Realization, Value Model, Autonomous\nOperation Maturity Model, Capability Optimization Blueprint, and AO Maturity\nBenchmarking. The model is represented in the following figure. (Figure 1 - Mama\nframework).\nFigure 1. MAMA framework\n2.1. Modules in the Framework\n2.1.1. Autonomous Operations Strategic Initiative (filter)\nIdentifying and scoping an Autonomous Operation Strategic Initiative starts the\nengagement of any Autonomous Operations project.\nThis module provides a decision filter (Figure 2) that helps to define the strategic\nobjective(s) and goal(s) that establishes the foundations (why) of the project. This\nstrategic filter identifies \"which and what\" initiatives are worthwhile investments for the\nenterprise based on applicable circumstances. While enabling \"blue sky\" projects to\ncontinue, the need to balance \"ideas\" and the \"technical implementation\" of them with\nactual impact on the enterprises business vision, mission and strategy of the\norganization adds to the critical success factor of such initiatives.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 32\nGB1040 MAMA Framework Guidebook v1.0.0\nFigure 2. MAMA AO Strategic Initiative filtering system\nAutonomous Operations in the automation spectrum requires a complex mix of\nadvanced technologies in combination with organizational and process changes. Key\nenablers come from a broad range of AI techniques including machine learning as well\nas machine reasoning algorithms. Furthermore, it requires a re-work of operations with\na clear focus on business value.\nWith so many concepts competing for the same enterprise investment \"purse\", a\nmechanism to evaluate, include and filter out what is actual, near, mid and long term\nvalue is key to stay on course with an enterprise’s business strategy. Having a\nstrategic filter helps to prioritize the projects and programs, along with their activities for\nthe organization. This helps to match \"resources\" and \"investment\" to fact-based\neconomic returns. In MAMA, the Autonomous Operations strategic filter offers a set of\nquestions to enable match specific projects within AO initiative to an organization's\nenterprise business strategy and target operating model.\nThis module in MAMA helps business teams to conduct relevant research and answer\nquestions with project sponsors and executives. The enterprise can understand its\nrequirements, goals and related intents in order to generate a filter - qualitative vs\nqualitative filters, or hard (an initiative that fails to pass through the filter) vs soft (an\ninitiative with priority scale that ranges from high to low) filters to make clear and\nconcise decisions that are hard coded with contribution to business value increment.\nThis module also gets feedback from any future benchmarking of AO initiatives, as\nthese impact position in the industry among peers, operating group or market at large.\n2.1.2. Value Realization\nThe \"value realization\" module, with a reference depiction in Figure 3, helps to identify\nall capabilities required to deliver the objectives and goals defined by the business\nteams.\nUse of the “Value stream” methodology requires a \"value realization\" that is linked to\nthe vision and mission of the organization. Supporting \"value realization\" are the value\nstreams that will/are defined to embody all the value-adding activities that cascade into\nan overall value cadence of the organization, as well as critical to stakeholder’s value.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Enterprise x \"Value Realization\" model - for reference only.\nUsing the value realization module, business capabilities, which are cross-functional,\ncan then be developed and managed to realize the value defined. Please note that\nbusiness capability as defined here comprises people, processes, resources and\ninformation. Value Model provides a model on how values are measured and tracked.\n2.1.3. Value Operations Framework (Value Model)\nThe “value model” is a three-layer representation that brings together “business value”,\n“business outcomes” and “operational metrics”.\nFigure 4.

Closed-loop Steps of MAMA Framework\nMAMA framework is a closed-loop methodology with steps designed to define,\nmeasure and manage Autonomous Operation transformation projects so that the\nbenefits of these AO projects can be aligned to the overall business goals and\nobjectives.\nIn most cases, autonomous operation transformation projects are initiated by technical\nteams with focus usually set on defining technical deliverables. By aligning these\ntechnical deliverables to business goals and objectives, it is easier for enterprising\norganizations and their stakeholders to appreciate the benefits of these transformation\nprojects.\nFigure 7. The Strategy pyramid\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 18 of 32\nGB1040 MAMA Framework Guidebook v1.0.0\n3.1. Stepping through the frameworks modules\n3.1.1. Defining AO initiative\nThis is the first step to using the MAMA framework, that is to define the autonomous\noperation initiatives.\nInitiatives describe the ambition and motivation of the business. Along with these\ninitiatives are actions that the organization must take to achieve its business goals and\nobjectives. In planning the AO initiative, a clear understanding of the corporate\nstrategic objectives is critical. Strategic objectives may have different dimensions,\nincluding financial-focused objectives, customer-focused objectives, internal-focused\nobjectives, and even learning objectives. In an example, a financial objective can be to\n“increase add-on sales by 40% in 2 years”, with related customer-focused objectives\nthat require “seamless quality of service experience delivery across, say, 5 cities in a\ncatchment area in 3 years”. The clear understanding of the strategic objectives\nenables identify the directly related measures and targets of the AO initiative targeted.\nThe right Autonomous operation initiative then becomes the key investment required to\nachieving the organizations’ strategic objective.\n3.1.2. Develop business capabilities\nThe second step is to develop the business capabilities required to deliver the\nmeasures and targets defined by the autonomous operation initiatives.\nBusiness capabilities include People, Process, Resources and Information, and\nrepresent the abilities the organization needs to have to realize business value. The\nvalue stream methodology in the MAMA framework is used in this stage to enable\nachieve and realize such values.\nBy defining the sequential or parallel flow of values (or value stage), the transformation\nproject team can then specify the value items at every stage of the value realization\nprocess that contribute to the overall business value. For the example used above,\nsubjective and objective measures such as network reliability, quality of service and\ncustomer care satisfaction can contribute to the overall quality of experience. The\nrelated value streams can be “assuring network reliability”, “assuring customer network\nexperience”, and “get customer care”. To realize these values, different value stream\nstages and supporting business capabilities are needed. Business capabilities\nincluding index modeling, risk auto-detection and evaluation, fault identification and\ndemarcation, root cause analysis & demarcation and intent resources matching are\namong some of them.\n3.1.3. Develop the value tree\nThe third step is to develop the value tree using the value model.\nThe value model is called “Value Operation Framework”, or VOF in the MAMA\nframework to accentuate the focus on \"operations\". The value Model is a 3-layer\nmodel as the top level are the values delivered to the stakeholders, which is generated\nby the value streams. The second level is measuring the outcome generated by the\nbusiness capabilities. These outcomes will then aggregate to the values that the\nstakeholders perceived. As the same outcome generated by a business capability will\nnot mean value to every stakeholder, the aggregation logic can be adjusted based on\nthe actual implementation of projects as time progresses.\nThe third level is the operational metrics that measure the efficiency and effectiveness\nof business capabilities. To develop the value model using VOF, please refer to the\nTM Forum Introductory Guide IG1292 for further details. Based on the “quality of\nexperience” example above, the top level metric may be a “customer experience index”\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 32\nGB1040 MAMA Framework Guidebook v1.0.0\ncomposed of the “network availability and reliability”, “quality of service” and “net\npromotion score”. The second level business capability metrics related to network\nreliability and customer experience can be “expected demand not served”, or EDNS,\n“average time and cost for problem resolution”, “customer experience index model\naccuracy rate”, “auto demarcation accuracy rate” and “auto quality ticket creation\nrate”. For further details on EDNS, please refer to the TM Forum Introductory Guide\nIG1294. For our example above, the third level operational metrics can be “risk auto-\ndetection rate”, “fault identification time”, “ticket dispatching automation rate”, “fault\nclosed-loop time”, “first call resolution rate”, “number of quality tickets”, and “service\nquality handling time”.\n3.1.4. Assess AO behaviors and correlated business capabilities\nThe fourth step is to assess the business behaviors and underlying business\ncapabilities that characterize expected business outcomes. These AO behaviors and\nexpected business outcomes must support the realization of business value based on\nthe measures and metrics defined in the VOF.\nOperations behavior and related business capability dimensions are assessed based\non the People, Process, Resource and Information. The assessment model, called\nAutonomous Operation Maturity Model, or AOMM, can provide an AO project delivery\nthe results for evaluating the maturity by way of business capability and the resulting\nAO behavior. For scenarios to derive an AOMM, please refer to TM Forum document\nGB1042B.\nThe evaluation scope for AO and related dimension for assessing maturity level of AO-\nrelated business capabilities are work in progress.\nWith the known business capabilities maturity and gaps from assessment results of\nAOMM, the project team can then develop plans to improve the business capabilities\nby defining the “Capability Optimization Blueprint”. The blueprint should cover\nimprovement plans for all 4 dimensions of business capabilities, which are People,\nProcess, Resources and Information. Detail plans for different organization units\nshould be put in place for improvement on talent re-skilling, process improvement,\napplication & API development and system & data integration. The project team shall\ncontinuously monitor the improvement results and provide feedback to AOMM for\nconstant maturity evaluations of the business capabilities.\n3.2. Framework Principles\nThe principles of the MAMA Framework help to manage technology investments and\nautonomous operation value in an era of proliferating solution offerings, business\nmodel innovation, service delivery transformation, operations transformation, digital\ntransformation and an extensive array of information and communication technologies\nand more.\nThey reflect accumulated lessons learned and best practices of service providers,\nsolution providers, equipment suppliers, consultants and more. The principles shift the\nnarrative for unlocking business value from one that is holistic and integrated.\nThe principles cannot be prescriptive because of the vast diversity of circumstances\nand conditions experienced according to the lifecycle stage of an operating enterprise.\nRather, the principles provide guidance for investment analysis, strategy management,\nproduct managers and financiers etc. of digital transformation initiatives.\nThe following are principles for use of MAMA Framework.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 20 of 32\nGB1040 MAMA Framework Guidebook v1.0.0\n3.2.1. Principle #1 - Make Stakeholder Value central\n• The need to align the enterprise’s goals with stakeholder needs. The enterprise\nshould initiate strategic investment initiatives with clear definition and use of\nmeasurable objectives, and at the same time prioritize such investments to\nmeet current and future plans. The core purpose of MAMA is to drive the\nrealization of business value based on the strategic alignment of information\nand communications technology investments with the focus on the business\ngoals of the enterprise.\n• Operation initiatives must be driven and aligned with the corporate overall\nstrategy goals and objectives. Establish objectives statement as clear\nmeasures with targets. E.g., “Increase revenue” is a goal, where “Increase\nvalue-added service revenue by 40% in 2 years” is an objective.\n• MAMA framework covers all zero-touch operations aspirations, and the\nautonomous operations initiative. It is not constrained or restricted to any one\nproject. In general, MAMA framework is applicable to any strategic initiative by\nthe enterprise. With heightened focus on use of AI, particular emphasis on AI\nand data-driven massive automation in the enterprise has raised the need to\nconsider, beyond the adoption and application of technology on the peripheries\nof business, as a core part of the existence of an enterprise itself.\n3.2.2. Principle #2 - Identify \"where\" and \"why\" an initiative is needed. Make\n\"wants\" subjects of \"needs\"\n• When Autonomous Operations is referenced, it is more than a technology\nimplement of an enterprise. Autonomy of a business and enterprise begins with\nstrategy to impact operations. Technology enables realize the efficiencies of\nscale and scope.\n• Value must have an \"owner\" and related \"stakeholders\".\n3.2.3. Principle #3 - Separate \"what\" from \"how\"\n• For the \"enterprises\" focus, the enterprise's productivity plan sets the scene for\nrealizing value from technology investments. The enterprising means to create\nvalue lies with the value fabric, or value chain, or value stream it owns or is part\nof. The means to create value are critical to the enterprise and its business, and\nso the need to reflect investments on what makes for best engaged value\ncontribution will be foundational.\n• Decompose the value fabric/ value chain/ value stream into clear business\ncapabilities. Note that while business capabilities are not generic, they provide\nan approximation of an expected outcome that will be clearly defined based on\nbusiness processes. Identifying all the contributing and impacted business\nprocesses that fit the specific business capability positioning for the enterprise\nwill be key to maximize value to the enterprise’s business. MAMA framework\naddresses business value for autonomous operations as a whole, instead of\nfocusing on just the technology part.\n• Value streams and value stream stages express the journey of \"how” and must\ndefine action and context.\n• Business capabilities establish the how and can have multiple levels. Ensure\nmapping the of the business capability to the right operating unit in order to\nestablish accountability and ownership.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 21 of 32\nGB1040 MAMA Framework Guidebook v1.0.0\n3.2.4. Principle #4 - Decompose \"what\" with use of standardized \"hows\"\n• Enterprises might have various interpretations and finesse around their \"what\",\nbut a fairly well established set of \"hows\" can be tools and best practices\nachieving the specificities related to their what.\n3.2.5. Principle #5 - Measure \"how\", and assess \"what\"\n• The purpose of MAMA is to measure and manage values for autonomous\noperation initiatives. Values are not limited to financial values but also social\nvalues, environmental and governance values.\n• Measuring is relevant and critical because initiatives serve as methods or\ninstruments to realize the enterprises business goals for certain outcomes. In\nan era of digital transformation, data can be engineered, generated and\nmanaged to attain numerical representations of \"how well\", \"how good\" or \"how\nfar\". Assess to validate quality of behavior towards realizing the \"hows\". One\napproach is to identify high level business objective achievement around what\nhas been achieved and what could not be achieved based on how operational\nbusiness units performed.\n• Measuring and managing the value of AO transformation initiatives is a\ncontinuous process. Having a mechanism in place to track and govern,\naltogether, the ongoing effectiveness and efficiencies of an autonomous\noperation initiative is key to be factual about promised value.\n• All values and metrics defined in the VOF must be measurable. The\nrelationship between the 3-level of values in VOF can be logical and/or\nmathematical.\n3.2.6. Principle #6 - Automation can apply to anything done. Autonomy is a\nspecific thing. Both must serve the interest of principle #1\n• For Autonomy ambitions with use of technology, autonomous is a behavior\nbounded by capabilities for technology-backed operations to self-govern and\nself-adapt. The ability to automate these capabilities with newer and better\ntechnologies is an ambition that must serve the termed view of the enterprise -\nshort-, mid- and long-term.\n• Investing and implementing autonomous operations solutions must not\noutweigh the interests of the enterprise and its business operation's integrity.\n3.2.7. Principle #7 - Start the \"how\" small, and scale big to address \"what\"\nvalue is accrued to the end stakeholder\n• Business growth is not equivalent to business scaling. Enterprise business\nscaling is when revenue increases without substantial increase in resources.\nGrowth refers to increasing revenue as a result of being in business. Growth\nexpands to cover all the resources, including an increasing number of\nemployees, number of landed facilities etc.\n3.2.8. Principle #8 - Assure Business Model compatibility\n• Business Capability development and in-operations business models must be\naligned. Consider what is “Nice to have sometime in the future” to “critical\nimmediate necessity.”\n• Observations from digital transformation investments have proven time and\ntime again that what can sometimes feel like an incremental, customer-facing\nsolution results in significant business model issues. The difference between\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 22 of 32\nGB1040 MAMA Framework Guidebook v1.0.0\ngrowth and scaling becomes most clear when a company isn’t a startup\nanymore, but is not a large corporation yet, either.\n3.2.9. Principle #9 - Single glass view with uniformity and universal\nbenchmarking\n• Method, approach and measurements aspects of operations need to be uniform\nand be established on common ground.\n• The benchmark needs to be established within CSP, or within region or across\nglobe. Some operational benchmark values need to be adopted from\norganizations like TMF, ETSI, ITU or local regulators. KPIs like EDNS KPIs may\nassist in establishing a solid foundation.\n3.3.

MAMA Governance\nMAMA Framework Governance plays an essential role to ensure that interests in use\nand evolution of MAMA framework lives up to the needs of member companies, and\nthe collective good of the industry.\nThe Framework Governance is important as it drives:\n• Direction: The collective direction of the industry, amidst an era of spiraling\nadoption of new digital technologies, digital architectures and digital/business\ntransformation strategies, is to grow business value of investments, and\nimprove business outcomes for stakeholders. All involved AO strategic initiative\nstakeholders must have a commitment to MAMA, follow and stick to the\nmethodology prepared by TM Forum members in defining business values,\nbusiness outcomes and measuring and assessing them.\n• Transparency: All decisions that will guide MAMA framework development and\nmaintenance shall be based on collective reasoning, carefully evaluated, and\nagreed upon by different owners of TM Forum themes, TM Forum specific\ndomain architectures and framework owners.\n• Independence: All TM Forum themes, specifically AO theme, have been\nsuccessful in defining their standards' development path and activities.\nTherefore, decision-making and mechanisms used in MAMA must be\nestablished to minimize or avoid conflict of interest.\n• Accountability: All TM Forum working groups are authorized by their charters,\nand accountable for decisions regarding work on their best practices and\nstandards development work.\n• Responsibility: Each TM Forum standards and best practice asset\ndevelopment working group is required to act responsibly to collective good of\nTM Forum members and the industry at large.\n• Fairness: No unfair advantage to any one particular project or initiative.\n4.1. Change Management for the Framework\nMAMA Framework changes may be driven by one or more of need for more\nsimplification, incremental change to improve the framework and a re-design based on\nnew business and management methodologies.\nThe objective of managing change to the framework is to ensure framework lifecycle is\nmaintained, as well as driving effective governance of the framework execution. This\nalso implies that the expertise and experience behind the development of the\nframework are current with TM Forum member interests and themes.\nChange Management of the MAMA framework shall cover steps to:\n• Prime consistently focuses on establishing value realization in the MAMA\nframework.\n• Facilitate a well-documented mechanism and/or technique(s) to monitor the\nvalue components (value fabrics, value streams, business capabilities,\nbusiness processes)\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 26 of 32\nGB1040 MAMA Framework Guidebook v1.0.0\n• Analyze, collectively as an industry forum, and manage risks brought by the\nframework and risks to the Framework (based on project, or by initiative as well\nas by theme/across themes)\n• Provide analysis for MAMA framework changes and the management of the\nchanges. E.g., what is the impact on the value operations framework (VOF)\nwhen the value streams for a value model are changed?\n• Develop change requirement to meet MAMA targets\n• Manage this governance model, and ensuring process; and\n• Provide the process to implement changes to the Framework.\n4.2. Industry Business Motivation management\nThe communications service industry has a collective business motivation that is multi-\nfaceted, with some key facets focused on competing favorably, partnering for\nprofitability and also becoming sustainable with the emerging and dominant alternate\nservice providers. It's the collective industry participating stakeholder motivations that's\ndriving MAMA framework. Governance of MAMA Framework, and changes to it shall\nbe led by the collection of industry members in order to make MAMA a continuing\nvalue-delivery framework.\nIndustry business motivation will be synthesized through member nomination and be\nanchored on shared set of value fabrics/chains/streams. This shall also imply the need\nto use evidence-based good practices and experiences in order to be as close as\npossible always to the practicality of the MAMA framework. This is also important to\nsupport cases where benchmarking for monitoring progress are required by members\nand serve as a driver for successful and value-outcome-based digital transformation.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Summary\nWhen applying MAMA Framework, the following summary provides some guidelines in\nthe current release plan that are related to current release of MAMA standards and\nintroductory guides.\n• Operation initiatives must be driven and aligned to the overall corporate\nstrategy goals and objectives.\n• Define the value cadence - value fabric, value chain and or value stream to\nestablish the outcome expected. In support of established business outcomes,\ndefining business value promises to be measurable based on the VOF model.\n• The relationship between the 3-level of values in VOF model can be logical\nand/or mathematical. Please refer to IG1292 Business Value Assessment and\nVisualization using VOF\n• The Autonomous Operation Maturity Model (AOMM) is the assessment module\nfor AO behavior and underlying business capabilities. All dimensions of\nbusiness capabilities must include the view of People, Process, Resources and\nInformation. Please refer to GB1042 Autonomous Operations Maturity Model\nand GB1042B Objective Approach to AOMM for further details.\n• The purpose of MAMA is to measure and manage the value of investing in\nAutonomous Operation initiatives. Therefore, value defined should be\nmeasurable. Values are not limited to financial values but also social values,\nenvironmental values and other values that can be measured. Please refer to\nongoing work-in-progress guide IG1293 Using the Value Operations\nFramework which include success stories and learnings to using MAMA to steer\nand realize value of AO investments.\n• Value must have an owner, and therefore related to a RASCI. New measures\ndefined must leverage data to provide factual benefit of AO to a stakeholder.\nPlease refer to IG1294 Introduction to Expected Demand Not Served (EDNS)\nas a new measure of value for operating autonomous networks.\n• Measuring and managing value for AO transformation is a continuous initiative\nand can relate to ESG. Having the mechanism in place within the organization\nto track and govern effectiveness and efficiencies altogether of AO initiatives is\nkey to realize business success is part of the critical success factor for AO\ninvestments today. Please refer to IG1298 ESG Impact on AO and Vice Versa\nv1.0.0 for ongoing work to identify and relate impact of ESG initiatives and AO\ninitiatives.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

Moreover, it provides the baseline for the marketing plan, campaign,\nsocial events and public white paper on behalf of the TM Forum and member companies.\nSimilar to the automobile industry, the telecom industry can offer one-stop shop, network/ICT\nservices based on the automation levels of service lifecycle operations in addition to the\ntraditional SLAs e.g. availability, bandwidth & QoS, which will significantly facilitate the digital\ntransformation of various industries (e.g. smart city, smart manufacturer, smart healthcare)\nand digital life of consumers.\nIn order to reach this goal, the telecom industry (including CSPs, suppliers, consultants and\nintegrators) and other vertical industries should collaborate and formulate a new partner\necosystem model from current Customer-SP-supplier models that will lead to the on demand,\nreal-time, customized business relationships associated with a Platform Ecosystem.\nAccordingly, the partners within telecom industry - CSPs, suppliers, consultants and integrators\nalso need to transform their relationships to a collaborative production model that can enable\nthe automated network/ICT services to other verticals and consumers, as well as internal\noperations efficiency.\nTherefore, it is essential to develop a framework for autonomous networks and define the\nautonomous levels at cross-industry level from the aforementioned partner ecosystem and\ncollaborative production model perspective, which the development follows the principles of\nuser centric, business driven and top-down, similar to the categorization of autonomous\nvehicles by SAE for easy understanding and consensus.\nIn a nutshell, the framework of autonomous networks consists of “3-layer, 4-closed-loop”, i.e.\nbusiness operations layer, network operations layer and network resource layers, and network\nresource closed loop, network operations closed loop, business operations closed loop and\nmore importantly cross layer closed loop from a user perspective. In order to fulfil the above\nclosed loops, the key mechanisms are:\na) reducing complexity by simplifying the network architecture;\nb) autonomous domains for network resource closed loop;\nc) cross-autonomous-domain collaboration for network operations closed loop;\nd) business ecosystem and collaboration enablement for business operations closed\nloop.\nThis will be a long-term project that requires the collaboration internally with the AI, digital\necosystem, and IT/network transformation programs of the TM Forum, as well as collaboration\nwith cross industry organizations such as GSMA, ETSI, 3GPP, Open sources (e.g. Linux\nfoundation), and other verticals e.g. IIC, industry 4.0, 5GAA and GIO.\nThis work was kicked off by a workshop entitled “Autonomous networks – building the\nnetwork of the future” in May 2019 during DTW, Nice; and then followed up with a workshop\nin July in London, which discussed the overall work plan and roadmap as summarized in this\ndocument.\n© TM Forum 2019.

Page 5 of 27\nIG1193 Cross-Industry Autonomous Networks – Vision and Roadmap\nIt is expected that several workshops and marketing events will be held in September (Dallas),\nNovember (Kuala Lumpur), February (Lisbon) and June (DTW - Copenhagen). The outputs\ninclude the umbrella white paper, vision & roadmap, user stories & use cases, business\nrequirements/metrics/ architecture, technical architecture, interface & API specs, catalyst\nprojects, eventually testing &verification program of autonomous levels and capabilities.\n© TM Forum 2019.

Introduction\nIn every industry we are seeing varying degrees of digital transformation, from the launch of\n5G in the telecommunications industry to the development of prototype autonomous vehicles,\nthe creation of smart services within cities, the trialing of smart health services, the drive for\nindustrial automation to support smart manufacturing, to the exploitation of low latency and\nhigh bandwidth for cloud based gaming services. These are all just examples of the\nopportunities being discussed for telecommunications companies to play this leading Digital\nService Enabler (DSE) role in the transformation of 21st century life.\nWith service providers in every industry striving to transform their production process and\nmanagement operations into a more agile, flexible and collaborative mode by taking\nadvantage of emerging digital technologies, it is obvious, to all but the casual observer, that\nthe need for automation and intelligence across all domains is pivotal to fully enable and\nexecute a digital transformation. The foundation of enabling automation and intelligence in\nevery industry is how to provide easy-to-use, automated and quick responsive information\nprocessing capabilities AKA fully automated intelligent ICT services that includes connectivity\nservice but also beyond-connectivity services from e2e perspectives, i.e. end-to-end closed\nloop of information/data collection, distribution, analysis, decision and operations in the\ncontext of the production and services of SPs.\nThis is especially true in the world of telecom industry which up until now have been trapped\nwith outdated thinking associated with elongated and protracted negotiations around\nstandards that have followed a very “waterfall” type approach to their development. Networks\nmade up of bespoke elements with fragmented elements and intricate interfaces have\ncomplicated the construction and operations, constrained innovation and stifled\ntransformation.\nFinally, we are seeing the thinking from the world of software start to gain traction amongst\nprogressive thinking network architects and engineers. As network components are developed\nusing agile, DevSecOps techniques coupled with technological advances in computing\ninfrastructure, especially in the domain of virtualized storage and computing processors, and\nreplication of standardized components to enable much higher levels of scalability and\navailability than was economically possible with dedicated hardware and infrastructure, it is\nnow possible to design, build and run virtualized software defined networks components with\nthe speed, security, reliability and availability previously associated with bespoke, vendor\nspecific, network elements. As the network elements become software enabled and\nvirtualized, it is essential that the components that deliver these network services are grouped\nas autonomous domains to enable fully automated closed loop of the management and\ncontrol of the elements. To achieve this the network services must be abstracted into a set of\ncommon services that represent the business capabilities that they deliver, and these\ncapabilities need to be encapsulated and exposed at the autonomous domain level and be\ninteracted across the autonomous domains through operations and management applications\nvia a set of industry agreed API’s and microservices. These services then need to be able to be\ninstantiated, updated, started, modified and stopped, fully automatically and in real time\nwhere appropriate. This implies an unprecedented level of network automation that is\ntheoretically possible, but absolutely essential, if service providers are going to remain\nrelevant in today’s digital world.\nAs industries transform as a result of digitalization then to deliver the flexible production and\npersonalized customer experience that wants an always on, never failing, instantly responsive\nnetwork/ICT services it will be necessary to take advantage of emerging technologies such as\nAI, big data, cloudification and virtualization to provide fully automated, self-healing and self-\n© TM Forum 2019.

The autonomous networks are characterized by\nproperties such as self-configuring, self-healing, self-optimizing, self-evolving and delivering an\ninfrastructure that has the abilities of zero-wait, zero-trouble, zero-touch service offering and\noperations from the user perspective.\nThe Open Digital Architecture (ODA) has identified two key opportunities for CSP's where\nAutonomous Networks play a critical role:\n1. Digital Operations Efficiency: Evolution of networks towards dynamic, software and\nvirtualized solutions leads to increased scale and velocity of network change. Operational\nefficiency can only be maintained through automation where Autonomous Networks\ncapabilities handle routine events.\n2. Digital Service Enablement: Opportunities are emerging for CSPs through partnering and\nplatform business models where they provide trusted enablers to Vertical Industry\nCustomers. One enabler is easy to use and modify Networks as a Service. Autonomous\nnetworks facilitate customer self-service for scaling and dynamic re-configuration of NaaS\nwhilst handling the complexities of dynamic networks invisibly e.g. virtualization, closed\ncontrol loops, policy, etc.\nFor service providers to be successful with their AI and automation strategies, they need to\ncome together with the wider industry ecosystem to build a common understanding of\nautonomous networks.\n© TM Forum 2019.

Intended Audience\nAs we have indicated in the introduction it is essential that the design and development of\nautonomous networks is not perceived to be confined to the telecommunications industry, but\nthey must be developed to support a much wider cross industry ecosystem that enables\ntelecommunications service providers to participate in, and actively support, the digital\ntransformation of many different industries.\nThis paper is targeted at decision makers across all industries undergoing digital\ntransformations, as well as being of particular relevance to CIO’s, CTO’s together with their\narchitects and designers from both IT and networks backgrounds as we are seeing the\nconsolidation of software thinking across the worlds of IT systems and networks.\nThis document will also position the TM forums work on autonomous networks in relation to\nother standards organizations so that it is unambiguous as to the role that each organization\nwill play in the development of the solutions going forward.\n© TM Forum 2019.

Autonomous Networks Vision\nThe following section lays out the vision for how we will build and manage Autonomous\nNetworks over the coming years. It will paint a vision of what will be necessary and achievable\nwithin approximately 3 years to address the challenges and opportunities that ultra-reliable,\nlow latency, high-bandwidth, automated fixed-mobile converged communications services\noffer to both individuals and organizations to generate and augment, new or additional, value-\nadded revenue streams that depend upon and exploit this technological advancement.\n3.1. Objective\nThe plan for this work on Autonomous Networks is to support a set of innovative network\nservices that enable the digitalization of vertical industries e.g. smart city, smart manufacture\nand self-driving cars, as well as the digital life of consumers through fully automated intelligent\nbusiness and networks operations of ICT/network services by taking advantage of artificial\nintelligence, big data, cloud computing, IoT and 5G etc. cutting technologies, which requires\nthe new collaborative production model, new knowledge-as-a-service operations model and\nnew simplified network architecture, as well as new digital partner collaboration and\necosystem model.\n3.2. Definition of\nautonomous networks\nAutonomous networks aim to provide fully automated zero wait, zero touch, zero trouble\ninnovative network/ICT services for vertical industries users and consumers, and support self-\nconfiguration, self-healing, self-optimizing and self-evolving telecom network infrastructures\nfor telecom internal users: planner, service/marketing, operations and management. The\nAutonomous Networks comprises simplified network architecture/autonomous domains and\nautomated intelligent business/network operations for the closed-loop of digital business,\nwhich offer the best-possible user experience, full lifecycle operations automation/autonomy\nand maximum resource utilization.\nIn order to measure the maturity and capabilities of autonomous networks, it is necessary to\ndefine a common consensus of autonomous levels.\n3.3. Levels of autonomous\nnetworks\nThe purpose of autonomous networks levels:\n• Define the concept of autonomous networks\n• Identify six levels from “no automation” to “full autonomy”\n• Base definitions and levels on functional aspects of technology\n• Describe categorical distinctions for a stepwise progression through the levels\n© TM Forum 2019.

The system possesses closed-loop automation capabilities across multiple\nservices, multiple domains, and the entire lifecycle, achieving autonomous networks.\nThe lower levels can be applied now and deliver immediate cost and agility benefits in certain\nscenarios. An operator can then evolve to the higher levels, gaining additional benefits and\naddressing a wider range of scenarios.\n© TM Forum 2019. All Rights Reserved. Page 11 of 27\nIG1193 Cross-Industry Autonomous Networks – Vision and Roadmap\nIt is a long-term objective with step-by-step processes, from providing an alternative to\nrepetitive execution actions, to observing and monitoring the network environment and\nnetwork device status, making decisions based on multiple factors and policies, and providing\neffective perception of end-user experience. The system capability also starts from some\nservice scenarios and covers all service scenarios.\nThis transformation will take several years, so we are following an evolutionary process of\ngradually introducing automation into different domains to bring immediate value.\n3.4. New Ecosystem and\nbusiness models\nThe ultimate goal of autonomous networks is to upgrade the telecom market structure with\nsimplified, automated and intelligent ICT/network services that will enable the digitalization of\nvarious industries and consumers. In order to achieve this objective, it is essential to transform\nthe existing production, business and collaboration models to some new models:\n• Digital partner collaboration and ecosystem model: all partners will collaborate to form\npartner ecosystem for offering on demand, personalized and real time services and\ncapabilities to the customers, which is different from traditional customer-provider-\nsupplier model, AKA everything as a service.\n• Collaborative production model: in order to achieve new partner ecosystem, a\ncollaborative production model is pivotal to leverage the best-suit solutions using best\nbreed technologies through win-win benefit sharing collaboration.\n• Knowledge-as-a-service operations model: in order to enable collaborative production, the\noperations knowledge should be shared and monetized through a common platform as an\nenabling service rather than cost reduction vehicle.\nIn a nutshell, the basic characteristics of autonomous networks:\n• Simplicity: simplified network architecture with fewer layers, less hops and\nmore integrated solutions\n• Autonomation: highly automated inclusive closed loop of network operations\n• Intelligence: Intent driven full lifecycle of business operations\n• Collaboration: enablement of easy-to-use and ecosystem of automated network/ICT\nservices\n© TM Forum 2019.

Autonomous Networks Principles\nAs we look at autonomous networks, we're not only talking about an evolution of the legacy\nnetwork where we try to incrementally fix some broken things, we're mainly talking about a\nrevolution within the intelligent automated network space. We are looking at how, using\nmodern software enabled technology, we can radically transform how network services are\nmanaged and delivered.\nThe concept of Autonomous Networks is of a network that provides the service lifecycle on\ndemand with minimal or no human intervention. The network can configure, monitor,\nmaintain and repair itself independently. By making use of emerging technologies such as\ncloud computing i.e. essentially unlimited parallel computing processor resources and\neffectively infinite storage, together with on-demand bandwidth that provides dynamic\nconnectivity, utilizing big data solutions to gather and analyze data from the ubiquitous array\nof network sensors for better pattern matching of potential service interrupting instances, and\nrules, model and intent driven software decision engines that learn (via analytics and rules,\nmachine learning or eventually the intent by artificial intelligence) how to maintain service and\nrepair resources in the event of some form of service or resource failure the concept of a fully\nautonomous network is becoming a reality.\nTelecommunication networks are complex and with the transition to cloud, the virtualization\nof network functions on the arrival of software defined networking what we are seeing is an\nincrease in the amount of complexity which in turn leads to difficulties in the development of\nproducts particularly those which are dependent upon network elements or network\nfunctions. It is imperative that we find a way of abstracting the complexity of the network to\nmake the management all for the network services and therefore the agility and speed of the\ndevelopment of network-based products simpler and faster.\nAs the “Internet of Things” grow then we quickly reach the scenario where most aspects of\nnetwork service management must be zero-touch because of the number of devices within the\nnetwork generating events there is an exponential increase in the volume they might have or\nvolume of data being generated and hence manual processes and activities to support the\nvolume and velocity of required change is no longer possible.\nIf we look at a network servicing 10,000,000 endpoints with say 10,000 nodes, then over the\nnext few years it's perfectly feasible that we could see these numbers increasing by up to a\nfactor of five. In terms of incidents per hour this would lead to an estimated 25-times increase\nfrom approximately 400 incidents per hour to as many as 10,000 incidents per hour. With this\nvolume of transactions, it would clearly be impossible to handle them manually.\nAs we look at autonomous networks, we are less concerned about the technology of the\nnetwork but what we're looking at is some critical ingredients that are going to simplify the\nmanagement and operations of the network. Open standards are an essential element of any\nnetwork transformation, together with the appropriate virtualization and normalization of the\nnetwork and its components which will enable flexibility, agility and simplicity we're looking at\ndemarcating and grouping the current network elements into autonomous domains and\nencapsulating the complexity of the network within the various autonomous domain. Each of\nthe autonomous domains will contain a closed loop of the infrastructure of both physical and\nvirtual network elements that support appropriate telemetry that enables the monitoring and\nmanagement of the network elements. To move towards an autonomous network, it is\nessential that we can expose a set of autonomous domain-based services that are easy to\nconsume. It is also important that any of the autonomous domains can be managed by an\nexternal software controller thereby enabling the cross-domain automation.\n© TM Forum 2019. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 27\nIG1193 Cross-Industry Autonomous Networks – Vision and Roadmap\nThe programmable infrastructure of physical and virtual network resources will produce\nsignificant amounts of data that can be used to determine trends from events and traffic\npatterns that can be learnt, and can be used to determine vulnerabilities or failures within the\nnetwork as they happen, or better still in advance of them happening so that proactive actions\ncan be taken to eliminate service or customer impacting events.\nWe want to ensure that the business capabilities that are exposed from the autonomous\ndomains are vendor agnostic and provide an abstracted set of services that simplify the\nnetwork architecture and therefore simplify the management of the network going forward.\nWe're bringing computer science and software design thinking to the design of networks to\nrevolutionize the management of networks.\nThe impending arrival of autonomous networks is essential to transform the economics\n(efficiency, timeline and cost) of managing networks from where we are today, which is\nessential, given the increasing complexity in networks and network technology with the advent\nof SDN, NfV and 5G.\nThe rationale of autonomous networks is to make the simplicity to the end users and leave the\ncomplexity within the providers, which requires zero-wait service launch, delivery and care,\nzero-touch operations and maintenance, zero-trouble infrastructure for new business models:\n• Autonomous network as a service: provide one stop, real-time, automated, on demand\nand customized full lifecycle network/ICT services\n• Autonomous network as a platform: enable business collaboration & ecosystem between\nvertical industries and network/ICT services\nMeanwhile, the autonomous networks can also provide the automation and intelligence of\noperations for the efficiency of existing and innovative services.\nIn order to achieve these objectives, some new approaches such as design-thinking and\nDevOps will be employed besides traditional static design and pipeline approaches.\n© TM Forum 2019.

Overview of Autonomous Networks\nFramework\nThe following section outlines the architectural framework necessary to deliver autonomous\nnetworks.\nFigure 2. Overarching framework: 3-layer + 4-closed-loop\nThe overarching framework of autonomous networks is 3-layer + 4-closed-loop:\na) 3-layers: represent a group of common capabilities and business logics that can be\nutilized to support all scenarios, as well as business relationships between the groups\nof atomic capabilities.\n• Network resources layer mainly provides the capabilities and business logics of\nnetwork resources and automation in each autonomous domain level\n• Network operations layer: mainly provides the capabilities and business logics of\nnetwork planning, design, roll-out, provisioning, assurance and optimization\noperations across multiple autonomous domains\n• Business operations layer: mainly provide the capabilities and business logics of\ncustomer, ecosystem and partner business enabling and operations for\nautonomous networks services\n© TM Forum 2019. All Rights Reserved. Page 15 of 27\nIG1193 Cross-Industry Autonomous Networks – Vision and Roadmap\nb) 4-closed-loops: represent the execution/fulfilment of the full lifecycle of the\noperations that can use the select capabilities of above layers upon corresponding\nbusiness process.\n• Network resource closed loop: the network needs to be upgraded from\nfragmented, siloed network element level integration towards a closed loop of\nnetwork autonomous domain based on an extremely simplified network\narchitecture, which lay the foundation for the closed loop of network operations\nand collaborative production by means of cross autonomous domain\ncollaboration\n• Network operations closed loop: the operations need to be upgraded from\nlegacy customized project-centric approach to a data/knowledge driven platform\nbased on full lifecycle operations automation. The most important part is a\nmindset change from a “build-and-operate” to a “design with operate”, and the\nrecognition of the value of operations knowledge as a service (KaaS). KaaS is\nabout delivering the right knowledge to the right person in the right context at\nthe right time via desktop, laptop or any mobile device. Operations automation\nsits at the core of production efficiency and business agility\n• Business operations closed loop: the operations needs to be upgraded from\nisolated business to on demand, automated business collaboration and\necosystem, which enables the closed loop for customer/business/ ecosystem\noperations, normally requiring collaboration across multiple service providers\nglobally\n• Cross layer user service closed loop: leveraging the above three layers’ and three\nclosed loop processes to support the user service fulfilment. The interactions\nacross the different layers should be based on simple, abstract API interfaces.\n5.1. Closed loops\nWith Autonomous Networks we see clearly the need for closed loops. In the past these control\nloops were largely confined to a single domain (e.g. the business layer or the network layer),\nhowever to deliver the level of automation required to manage the networks of the future it\nwill be necessary for the automatic closed loops to cross domains as indicated by the red ovals\nin the Figure 2, in addition to the closed loop of each single autonomous domain.\nIn these scenarios for example an incident in the network will impact a service, that service\ncould potentially have an impact on customers’ SLA, so the system will have to automatically\ndetermine if, based on the customers contract if an action must be taken. That action,\ndetermined by the SLA in the customer domain, may require a change to a service or resource\nin the production domain to ensure that the digital service provider continues to meet the\ncontracted SLA. If this needs to happen during the use of, or consumption of, the service then\nit is likely that the change will need to be made in real time. If that is the case then the\napplication of the change needs to be controlled automatically, without the need for human\ninteraction, and flowing a set of pre-determined rules (possibly machine learned) or the\nsystem makes a decision on the next action (AI enabled). To facilitate this sort of control on\nthe network from the customer SLA will require a set of network services that can be easily\nactivated through a set of consistent, pre-agreed, industry standard interfaces (Open APIs).\n© TM Forum 2019. All Rights Reserved. Page 16 of 27\nIG1193 Cross-Industry Autonomous Networks – Vision and Roadmap\n5.2. Autonomous domains\nAutonomous domains are the business disposition of network functions that is able to fulfil the\nclosed loop automation of the lifecycle of specific network operations. In other words, they are\nthe instantiations of network resource closed loops performing the automatic management of\nthe network resources and capabilities. The autonomous domains demarcate the network into\na set of cooperating domains upon the business logic of each CSP. Proposed examples of\nautonomous domains include the closed loops of access, metro backbone, core, edge,\ncustomer network from transport perspective, or SD-WAN, VoLTE, CDN etc. from service\nperspective.\nThe basic characteristics of autonomous domains include:\n• Each of autonomous domains exposes a set of services via Open APIs for those\nautonomous capabilities to be employed by upper level users.\n• Each of autonomous domain maintains a catalog of services for the domain, together with\nan inventory of service and resource instances that it knows about and is responsible for.\n• A set of autonomous domains must be identified and agreed that represent logical areas\nof the network that specific elements must reside within. As a rule, a network element\nshould be in one, and only one, autonomous domain.\nTo date these have been identified as the following architectural functions or services of\nautonomous domains:\n1. identify an industry agreed set of autonomous domains that represent networks of the\nfuture\n2. define a set of (vendor agnostic) network elements (or functions) within the various\nautonomous domains. These network elements or functions can be either physical or\nvirtual components, and will expose a set of standard resource services at the domain\nlevel instead of element or function level\n3. the ability to decouple one domain from another and expose a set of domain-based\nservices via Open APIs to upper layer or other domains\n4. the ability for a network element to configure itself and expose its characteristics to upper\nlayer or other domains to allow it to be externally controlled\n5. the ability to combine a set of network elements to build or deliver a higher-level network\nservice,\n6. the ability to deliver a service using a combination of flexible network services and\nresources that can be automatically orchestrated, configured, monitored and repaired\nusing the same or similar network services and resources,\n7. the ability to specify a set of rules at the business level (e.g. Service level availability,\nservice level guarantee based on response times, repair times etc.) that can be\nautomatically monitored and effected across all domains of the architecture, from here on\nreferred to as closed control loops\n8. the opportunity to model the exposure of network capabilities as a set of platform services\nto enable higher level business services to utilize network services\n© TM Forum 2019. All Rights Reserved. Page 17 of 27\nIG1193 Cross-Industry Autonomous Networks – Vision and Roadmap\n5.3. Loosely coupled\nAutonomous Domains\nTo maintain the simplicity, flexibility and agility of the architecture it is essential that we design\nthe autonomous domains to be loosely coupled. This implies that we will expose an agreed set\nof services out of each domain, using an industry agreed format to expose the services and\ncapabilities (suggestion is that we use TM Forum Open APIs to facilitate this).\n5.4. Self-configuring and\nself-optimizing network\nelements\nWhere a network element is physically deployed impacts its characteristics, for example, by\ndeploying a network element in an “edge cloud” which by definition is closer to the customer\nwill reduce the latency of the function being invoked or delivered by the network element. For\nresponse time critical functions this is a very important capability that will need to be catered\nfor within our architecture to support functions such as facial recognition for security services.\nWhen the network element is deployed, those characteristics that are dependent upon the\nphysical infrastructure must run a self-test and expose the results as part of the configuration\nof the network element. For example, this could involve pinging the end point of the network\nand measuring the response time to determine the latency characteristics. This self-\nconfiguration of the network element could also include the optimization of the network\nelement.\n5.5. Combining network\nelements to deliver\nhigher level services (RFS\nor CFS)\nWith the reusable components of the network it will be possible to combine elements or link\nelements together to build higher level services. In simple terms, and only by way of example,\nit should be possible to combine a firewall with an access service to build a secure access\nservice, or model an access service using two physical, and different, access types together\nwith a control switch that selects which access service to use, and it will be possible to build a\nresilient access service.\n5.6. Orchestration and\ncontrol of network\nelements\nA key component of an Autonomous Network is the ability to use service and resource\norchestration to deliver automation around service and network management. Orchestration\nis not limited to just the fulfilment process but across the complete service and resource\nlifecycle. We are therefore designing orchestration to automate network planning (proactive\nand reactive), customer order fulfilment and during the assurance process to support self-\n© TM Forum 2019. All Rights Reserved. Page 18 of 27\nIG1193 Cross-Industry Autonomous Networks – Vision and Roadmap\nhealing and self-optimizing (including new on-demand capacity to support scaling of the\nnetwork. With the abstraction and decomposition of the network into a set of cooperating\nautonomous domains, means that we need the ability to construct higher level network\nservices from the base services offered by autonomous domains. This is a common approach\nin software enabled product and service modelling and is the key to being able to build a set of\nreusable components that deliver the required business functionality of the network being\nmodelled in this way.\nTo enable this sort of functionality a series of orchestration capabilities will be utilized across\nthe architecture within and across different autonomous domains. This lower level resource\nfocused orchestration will be used to control and manage the lower level resources (both\nphysical and virtual) within autonomous domains utilizing analytics, machine learning and\neventually artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. Where the resources are virtual, this objective\nis for these orchestration functions to be fully automatic.\n5.7. Autonomous Networks\nexposed as services\nA Network Element is an architectural concept that represents telecommunication equipment\n(or groups/parts of telecommunication equipment) and supports equipment or any item or\ngroups of items considered as belonging to the telecommunications environment that\nperforms network element functions. A Network Element communicates with an operations\nsystem for the purpose of being monitored and/or controlled. (Source: ITU-T M.3010 Principles\nfor a telecommunications management network)\nTo enable the automated management of the network, the basic building blocks of the\nnetwork, the network elements, must be capable of being grouped as autonomous domains\nand managed by a domain orchestration for the closed loop of basic network services. Getting\nthe right level of abstraction within the network as autonomous domains will greatly simplify\nthis task. Suggested “atomic” network elements might include firewalls, routers, edge servers,\nload balancers, switches, etc.\n5.8. Autonomous Networks\nexposed as a platform\nWhen we have our network modelled as a set of reusable components that are controlled and\nmanaged automatically moves us closer to the objective of having our network available as a\nplatform service within the context of a wider digital ecosystem. Characteristics such as:\n• Plug and play capability\n• Flexible and agile\n• Low operational costs\n• Scalable\n• Secure by design\n• Easy on-boarding of new participants into the ecosystem\nWith these characteristics we envisage the network delivering digital enabling capabilities e.g.\nbusiness collaboration, on-boarding, service development & launch, customer experience\nmanagement etc.\n© TM Forum 2019.

Page 6 of 17\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.0.0\n1 Industry and Standardization Efforts\n1.1 Towards a shared vision of Autonomous Networks\nAutonomous Network initiatives are being progressed in multiple standards\ndeveloping organizations (SDOs), such as ETSI, 3GPP, and GSMA to name but a\nfew. An alignment on Autonomous Network concepts, a shared vision and\nframework would help the industry to progress in a coordinated way on this\nimportant initiative.\nAutonomous Networks evolution, standardization, and deployment will require an\nindustry- wide consensus and each stakeholder will need to learn how to\ncollaborate better to create the right approach. For standards work, SDOs will need\nto “share early and often”, align better and avoid duplication of effort.\nAutonomous Networks will evolve over a longer-term timeline and real solution\ndeployments using AI that delivers a high level of network automation (AN Level 4)\nare expected in the next 5 years. However, it is the next 2 years that will prove\ncrucial to its success. Concrete, tangible elements of the AN framework, generating\nthe initial benefits and return, will deliver partially autonomous systems. These\nreturns when reinvesting into the initiatives will bring bigger savings and the value\nbehind AN. Standards should move fast to prepare the conditions of\ninteroperability and commercial deployment of these autonomous systems.\n1.2 SDO Landscape Summary\nThe challenges and opportunities of AN are significant, and no single stakeholder\nor SDO is capable to cover the entire end-to-end perspectives of AN. The cross-\nSDO, industry-level collaboration to achieve consensus of key concepts and\nterminologies (e.g., AN definition, framework, autonomous networks levels) and\nthe development of key capabilities, mechanisms ,interfaces (e.g., control loops,\nautonomous domains, intent) is essential to the success of AN.\nFigure 1.

Page 10 of 17\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.0.0\nSDO Landscape\nThe following sub-sections list some of the recent contributions to the AN topic from various\nSDO organizations.\n2.1 European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI)\nETSI have a number of standards activities relating to Autonomous Networks:\n F5G (5th Generation Fixed Network),\n ENI (Improve operator Experience through closed loop AI),\n• NFV (Network Function Virtualization),\n• ZSM (Management/Automation of emerging and future networks and services).\nFigure 2. ETSI ISGs relating to AN (Source: ETSI 2020)\nFigure 2 shows the ISGs working in areas related to autonomous networks and identifies areas\nof contribution and convergence of scope of the various ETSI ISGs. ETSI plans to publish a\nwhitepaper on Autonomous Networks that shows the importance of coordination and\nknowledge sharing between the ISGs and all involved in the extended ecosystem, including\nSDOs, cross-vertical organizations, open-source alliances and research groups.\n2.2 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP)\n3GPP SA5 has progressed the following specifications in the general area of AN:\nArchitecture Framework\n• In Release 16, 3GPP SA5 took the architectural framework specified in GS ZSM 002\n(ZSM Reference Architecture) into account. The related description has been\ncaptured in TS 28.533 clause 5.3 “Management service deployment based on ZSM\nframework”.\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 11 of 17\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.0.0\nClosed Loop Assurance\n• In 3GPP Release 16, 3GPP SA5 has specified the concept for open control loop\nand closed control loop, as well as use cases, requirements and a model for\ncommunication service assurance closed control loop. Corresponding contents\nare captured in TS 28.535 and TS 28.536.\n• In 3GPP Release 17, 3GPP SA5 has started a new work item on enhanced closed\nloop SLS assurance.\nClassification of Network Autonomy for Fault recovery ( 28.810)\nIn addition, SA5 is currently working on the following Rel-17 topics that are relevant to AN:\n• Intent driven management service for mobile networks (see TR 28.812/TS\n28.312),\n• Management Data Analytics Service (see TR 28.809),\n• Autonomous Network Levels (see TR 28.810/TS 28.100).\n3GPP has also established the NWDAF (network data analytics function) working group to\nwork on 5G slicing and intelligent application research of 5G Core.\n2.3 International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication (ITU-T)\nThe ITU-T approved ITU-T Y.3172 in June 2019 to define the network AI framework, including\nthe intelligence level, data processing standards, and cases. The Focus group on Machine\nLearning for Future Networks including 5G (FG-ML5G) has developed an Architectural\nframework for machine learning in future networks including IMT-2020. The topics are related\nto Autonomous Networks but differ in focus and emphasis to the TM Forum work. The group\nhas published deliverables on architectural framework, high-level architecture, requirements\nand discussed topics such as intent, machine learning, orchestrator, ML pipeline, and the need\nfor ML sandboxes. Four important areas are shown in the callouts in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Overview of ML work in FG ML5G [Y3172] (Callouts added)\n© TM Forum 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 12 of 17\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.0.0\nIntent in Autonomous Networks\n3.1 Intent Standardization Efforts\nMany standard-developing organizations (SDO) are actively working on the topic of\nautonomous networks and associated intent-driven management. One of the key building\nblocks of intent-driven management is the intent meta-model which provides an abstract\nrepresentation of the schema and rules of the intent model, irrespective of the management\ndomain or specific management layer, and enables the extension of such a model wherever\nnecessary, depending on the context of usage. This is critical because the meta-model of the\nintent is one of the architectural considerations that can influence the functional blocks\nrequired for the autonomous network system to derive the semantic meaning and context of\nthe intent as well as helps to map intent to internal actions without ambiguities or conflicts.\nTable 3 lists some of the key standards in the area of intent-driven networking and categorizes\nthe standards by the following dimensions: conception definition, model, architecture,\nclassification (types, taxonomy), domain (scopes), and lastly, the relevant TM Forum AN Intent\nCategory (Business Intent, Service Intent, Resource Intent).\nTable 3.

All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 17\nAutonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.0.0\nTM Forum’s AN Project has also published a suite of guides on ‘Intent in Autonomous\nNetworks’. See below for the complete list of guides.\n1. IG1253 is a set of documents in which each document defines a separate aspect of\nintent-driven operation:\n2. IG1253 - Intent in Autonomous Networks\nThis is the main overview document. It contains a description\nof general definitions and operation principles. The documents A-E contain and deeper\nviews into some key topics.\n3. IG1253A - Intent Modeling\nThis document defines the modeling of intent objects as ontology graphs. It introduces\nthe concept of model federation based on a central intent meta-model and separate\ndomain-specific extensions and information models. This document then defines the\ncentral and domain-independent intent meta-model.\n4. IG1253B - Intent Information Models (future release)\nThis document adds to the model federation as defined in IG1253A and propose\ndomain-specific extensions and information models.\n5. IG1253C - Intent life cycle management and Interface\nThis document defines the life cycle of intent including the roles and responsibilities\nwithin the life-cycle. It then defines the interface and API used to execute the life-\ncycle management operations. This includes methods for communicating, modifying\nand removing intent objects, as well as negotiating intent content.\n6. IG1253D - Intent handler scope and capability management (future release)\nThis document defines a registration and discovery mechanism about the capabilities\nand scope of operation of distinct intent handler interfaces.\n7. IG1253E - Use cases and examples (future release)\nThis document is a collection of use cases with detailed examples that demonstrate\nhow to apply the principles and use the models and interfaces defined in the IG1253\nset of documents.\nSeparate to the Intent specification work above, TM Forum has also published a study called\nIG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches that examines the\nvarious approaches to intent modeling and intent expression languages from across SDOs and\nopen source communities [IG1259].\n© TM Forum 2021.

The 4 key\nelements of AN Framework are:\n1. Key Effectiveness Indicators. KEIs help CSPs identify what benefits they could\nreceive by upgrading their telecommunications system with more autonomy\ncapabilities.\n2. AN Levels. Operators benefit from having a clear view on their expected\nmaturity of their network so that they can focus on the important features they\nshould prioritize to achieve a defined level of autonomy in their networks.\n3. AN Target Architecture. The realizations of zero-touch operations using\nautonomous network reference architectures aims to focus solutions on the\nessential principles and patterns that will improve Self-X capabilities and\nthereby help operators to reach L3 and L4 levels of autonomy.\n4. AN Map (or Navigator). The AN Map is designed to help CSPs set and\ndecompose overall AN evolution objective from an end-to-end perspective and\nspecify the direction and priority of capability development.\nThese 4 elements are relatively independent and need to be further organized to form\na pragmatic how-to guide to facilitate implementation of AN. For each of these\nelements, pragmatic ‘how-to’ suggestions, as well as reference to applicable\nstandards, are given in this document. This document also briefly introduces the\noperation practice, covering two concepts, AN strategic planning and AN Journey. The\nindustry assessment and certification of AN is at an earlier stage, and will be\nelaborated in a future revision of this document.\n© TM Forum 2024. All Rights Reserved. Page 6 of 25\nIG1218F Autonomous Networks Framework v1.1.0\nIntroduction\nThis document introduces the overall framework and practice methods of AN\nFramework. It aims to provide a systematic method for operators from AN strategy\nplanning to implementation, and guide operators to carry out AN work more efficiently.\nC-level and senior managers, should focus on the value proposition and generational\ncharacteristics of ANF, control the direction of value and capability evolution of AN,\nunderstand the value brought by AN, and confirm whether AN goals are achieved. The\ngeneral owner of the AN work can focus on the ANF's effectiveness indicators,\nevaluation standards, target architecture, and the AN map, to formulate the operator's\nANSP, specify the overall objective and evolution path, define the key business scope\nof the AN, and coordinate the work division and capability evolution pace of each\nsystem. The AN implementation personnel of various technology and service domains\ncan focus on the AN Journey, master the closed-loop implementation methods based\non value scenarios, and perform iterative evolution to continuously improve the AN\nlevel.\n© TM Forum 2024.

The Autonomous Networks Framework\nOverview\nThe AN Framework is an out-of-the-box implementation guide and toolkit to guide\nCSPs’ AN transformation so that they can plan and implement AN in a more efficient\nand systematic manner and more quickly fulfill the vision of Zero-X and Self-X.\nFigure 1. Autonomous Networks Framework\nThe AN Framework includes all four key elements, operation practices, and industry\nassessment and certification.\n© TM Forum 2024. All Rights Reserved. Page 8 of 25\nIG1218F Autonomous Networks Framework v1.1.0\n2. Key Elements of AN Framework\n2.1. Key Effectiveness Indicators\nWhen an enterprise plans to undertake a strategy or investment, it must align its values\nand goals within the organization and measure the return on investment. Central to this\nprocess is the definition and measurement of key indicators.\nIG1252 [3] defines an evaluation methodology for Autonomous Networks Levels (AN\nLevel). AN Levels gauge the level of autonomy capability in a given operational\nworkflow or autonomous domain. However, AN Levels do not adequately reflect the\noverall impact or value of an autonomous network. Hence, there is a need to establish\nKey Effectiveness Indicators (KEIs) to help CSPs in determining the benefits of\nenhancing their telecommunications system with greater autonomy capabilities.\nThe value of these indicators lies in two aspects:\n1. visualizing and quantifying the effectiveness and benefits of AN evolution,\n2. and aligning the development of autonomous capabilities with the enterprise\nstrategy and service development trend.\nEffectiveness indicators and AN levels are the two key AN evaluation factors that jointly\nfacilitate the fulfillment of the Autonomous Network vision. KEIs can be used in the\nfollowing three scenarios:\n1. Formulating improvement objectives for AN based on KEIs. For example, if the\nservice delivery target at L4 is measured in minutes, the target baseline can be\nset based on an opco’s O&M status, experience of benchmark CSPs and\nannual investment budget. Note that the baseline value is not equivalent to a\ncharacteristic of L4.\n2. Guiding capability development by associating KEIs with operation capabilities\nand converting and breaking down capability requirements for example, the\ntime needed for optical transport network private line service delivery can be\nbroken down into various key capability metrics, such as the time needed for\nCPE deployment and solution design. These capability metrics can be mapped\nto specific functional requirements for support systems, operations and\nmaintenance centers, and network elements.\n3. Verifying the effectiveness of operation capability development based on KEIs\nto provide inputs for the next AN Journey – the inputs include adjustments to\nthe rationality of objectives, investment plan changes and optimized\ndevelopment directions.\n2.1.1. Indicator Framework\nTraditional Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are typically established in response to\noperational and maintenance (O&M) challenges or identified weaknesses. For\ninstance, when there are numerous customer complaints, indicators like the complaint\nrate are introduced to guide teams in enhancing product quality and service processes\nwhile reducing customer grievances. However, this approach primarily addresses\nisolated issues and lacks comprehensive planning and target guidance. It falls short of\nsystematically steering organizational and platform capability development. In light of\nthis, drawing from the balanced scorecard theory, the existing TM Forum Metrics\nframework (GB935 [10]/GB988 [11], etc.), and insights gained from operator\n© TM Forum 2024. All Rights Reserved. Page 9 of 25\nIG1218F Autonomous Networks Framework v1.1.0\nautonomous network Key Effectiveness Indicator (KEI) design practices, we propose\nan autonomous network KEI framework centered around value propositions. The\ndesign and decomposition methodology for this framework are illustrated in the\nfollowing diagram, Figure 2.\nFigure 2. Indicator Framework\nThe key features of this indicator framework are outlined below:\n1. Value-Centric Approach: KEIs are deliberately designed from a 'top-down'\nperspective, aligning with the four primary value propositions of the\nautonomous network. Each KEI is directly or indirectly linked to enhancing one\nor more of these value propositions. A corresponding set of effectiveness\nindicators is established for each recognized value proposition, facilitating\neffective measurement of the value delivered.\n2. Multi-Level Hierarchical Structure: The KEIs are structured hierarchically,\nsystematically breaking down the measurement levels based on the identified\nvalue propositions. This hierarchical structure forms a causal indicator tree. The\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs) reflects the main AN value propositions,\noffering a holistic view of AN's impact at both the company and industry levels.\nSimultaneously, it provides guidance on achieving effectiveness and\nestablishes internal appraisal requirements. Within each domain, detailed KPI\nrules can be formulated, and specific targets can be set based on the domain's\nunique KPIs and specialized areas of business. Furthermore, Key Capability\nMetrics (KCMs) can be further subdivided, driven by an analysis of process\nactivities and identified capability gaps during the AN journey within valuable\nscenarios. This sub-level decomposition guides the development of system\ncapabilities more effectively.\nThe distinction between Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Key Capability\nIndicators (KCMs) lies in their respective purposes. KPIs are business-oriented\nKEIs that focus on end-to-end outcomes, while KCMs serve as capability\nmeasures aimed at bolstering the attainment of Key Effectiveness Indicators\n(KEIs) by addressing specific process activity weaknesses. In essence, KEIs\nmeasure the achievement of business objectives, while KCMs gauge key\n© TM Forum 2024. All Rights Reserved. Page 10 of 25\nIG1218F Autonomous Networks Framework v1.1.0\ncapabilities. As technology and capabilities evolve, the essential KCMs within\na process may undergo changes, whereas KEIs tend to remain relatively\nstable. For instance, consider a troubleshooting scenario within a domain where\nthe KEI is the average troubleshooting duration. At present, accurately\nidentifying faults poses a challenge. Therefore, a suitable KCM can be defined\nas 'Fault Identification Accuracy.' As fault identification capabilities improve, the\nkey weakness may shift to fault diagnosis. Accordingly, KCMs can be redefined\nas 'Automatic Fault Diagnosis Rate' and 'Fault Diagnosis Accuracy Rate' to\naddress this evolving capability requirement.\n3. Consider both benefit and efficiency: When defining KEIs, it is important to\nconsider not only efficiency indicators like automation rates but also business\nbenefit indicators such as time consumption and quality. By incorporating both\nbenefit and efficiency aspects, a more comprehensive measurement system for\nKEIs can be developed. For example, in troubleshooting scenarios, it's\nessential to define not just the efficiency indicator of troubleshooting automation\nrates but also the benefit indicator of average troubleshooting duration.\n2.1.2. KEI Reference Set\nFor details about the reference set of effectiveness indicators and the definition of\nspecific indicators, see IG1256 Autonomous Network Effectiveness Indicators [4].\nThe following is an example:\nIndicator Time to Market Abbreviation TTM\nname\nUnit Day\nDefinition of Measure the time taken for new services or products from the initial\nthe indicator concept stage to market launch.\nIndicator This indicator reflects the ability of enterprises to launch new\nDescription services or products. The shorter the time to market, the quicker a\nreturn on investment can be realized. AN capability such as self-\norchestration and self-loading can quickly support the design,\ndevelopment, verification, and release of new services and\nproducts. The intent-based interface simplifies inter-system\ninterconnection and shortens the integration time. All these AN\ncapabilities can effectively shorten the product launch time.\nCalculation TTM = Total time from concept to launch of all new services or\nformula products÷Number of new services or products\nGo-to-market (or go-to-shelf) refers to the formal sale of a product in\nthe market and users can already buy the product.\nTable 1. KEI Reference Set Example\n2.2. Autonomous Network Levels\n2.2.1. AN L3/L4 characteristics\nThere is now industry consensus that AN Levels are defined based on cognitive\nclosed-loop theory and the degrees of a human-machine division of labor. An\nincreasing number of AN practitioners want to take an approach that is straightforward\nin that it defines AN Level characteristics in terms of business or service value. The\nIG1326 Autonomous Networks: Empowering digital transformation – evolving from\nLevel 2/3 towards Level 4 [9] has summarized general L4 characteristics and the key\n© TM Forum 2024.

Domain-specific L4 characteristics can be defined based on the guiding\nprinciples of the general L4 characteristics shown in the table.\nPerspective Dimension L3 L4 Description\nCharacteristic Characteristic\nCustomer Zero-wait Automated Automated L3: Services are configured\nservice service automatically in the\nprovisioning delivery provisioning phase.

Evolving from L3 to L4\n2.2.2. AN Level Standards\nLevel standards are guidelines for measuring the level of automated and intelligent\noperations in CSPs’ networks. These standards can be used to evaluate the levels of\nautonomy, identify weaknesses in autonomous capabilities, analyze gaps between the\nstatus quo and objectives, and guide CSPs to systematically plan and deploy\nautonomous capabilities.\nThe technical work of AN Level evaluation methodology is published in IG1252\nAutonomous Network Levels Evaluation Methodology [3], which describes the AN\nLevel evaluation approach and operation flows, tasks evaluation criteria, scoring\nmethod, etc. The table below shows the levels in more detail, with additional\nexplanation of the levels following.\nAutonomous L0: L1: L2: L3: L4: L5:\nLevels Conditional Highly Fully\nManual Assisted Partial\nAutonomous Autonomous Autonomous\nOperation & Operation & Autonomous\nNetworks Networks Networks\nMaintenance Maintenance Networks\nExecution P P/S S S S S\nAwareness P P/S P/S S S S\nAnalysis P P P/S P/S S S\nDecision P P P P/S S S\nIntent / P P P P P/S S\nExperience\nApplicability N/A Selected Scenarios All\nScenarios\nTable 3. Autonomous Network Level Taxonomy\n© TM Forum 2024. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 25\nIG1218F Autonomous Networks Framework v1.1.0\nLevel 0 – Manual management: the system delivers assisted monitoring capabilities,\nwhich means all dynamic tasks must be executed manually.\nLevel 1 – Assisted management: the system executes a certain repetitive sub-task\nbased on pre-configuration to increase execution efficiency.\nLevel 2 – Partially Autonomous Networks: the system enables partial automatic\nO&M for certain units based on pre-defined rules or policies under certain external\nenvironments.\nLevel 3 – Conditionally Autonomous Networks: building on L2 capabilities, the\nsystem with awareness can sense real-time environmental changes, and in certain\nnetwork domains, optimize and adjust itself to the external environment.\nLevel 4 – Highly Autonomous Networks: building on L3 capabilities, the system\nenables, in a more complicated cross-domain environment, analysis and decision-\nmaking based on predictive or active closed-loop management of service and\ncustomer experience-driven networks.\nLevel 5 – Fully Autonomous Networks: this level is the goal for telecom network\nevolution. The system possesses closed-loop automation capabilities across multiple\nservices, multiple domains and the entire lifecycle, achieving Autonomous Networks.\nThe AN Level can be applied to generic domain or to a specific network domain (i.e\ndomain-specific). On the one hand, we need to unify the concepts, principles and\nmethods so that the AN Levels of different networks and services can be compared\nhorizontally. On the other hand, the specific network and service characteristics of a\ngiven domain must be considered to better guide the AN capability planning and\nconstruction of different networks and services.\nThe IG1305 Autonomous Networks: Empowering digital transformation – from strategy\nto implementation [8] further describes the generic AN Level and domain-specific AN\nLevel and the relationship between them.\nFigure 3. Generic AN Level Characteristics and Domain-specific AN Level Characteristics\n© TM Forum 2024. All Rights Reserved. Page 14 of 25\nIG1218F Autonomous Networks Framework v1.1.0\n• Generic AN Level is applicable to all domains and services. It focuses on the\nAN Level concepts, principles, methods, and O&M task baselines, offering\nbasic categories for the usage and instantiation of domain-specific AN Level.\nThe core value of generic AN Level lies in ensuring consistent dimensions,\ngranularities, and terms of O&M tasks between different domains or services to\nsupport horizontal comparison and analysis of the AN Level evaluation result.\nThe Generic AN Level definition and evaluation method are described in TM\nForum IG1252 [3].\n• Domain-specific AN Level is applicable to a specific domain or service. It\ndefines the detailed rules for the domain or service based on the generic AN\nLevel, including the assessment rules of L1 to L5 and baseline scenarios.\nDomain-specific AN Level can be used to evaluate the AN Level of the domain\nor service and guide the evolution of autonomous capabilities in the domain or\nservice. For templates and examples of domain-specific AN Level, see Figure\n4. Domain-specific AN Level and evaluation method are defined by respective\nSDOs, e.g. 3GPP network and service AN Level is defined in 3GPP. TS28.100\n[7].\nFigure 4. Domain-specific AN Level and function map\nTo systematically strategize and cultivate autonomous capabilities while providing\nclearer guidance to Operators in reaching Levels 3 (L3) and 4 (L4), we deconstruct\nfunctional requirements within the BSS, OSS, and network layers (comprising NMSs\nand NEs). This deconstruction is based on domain-specific Autonomous Network Level\ncriteria and the key AN architecture principles, namely single-domain autonomy and\ncross-domain collaboration. The resulting functional requirements collectively compose\nwhat we refer to as the 'function map.' The domain-specific AN Level defines the\nobjectives of L3 and L4, whereas the function map illustrates the means to achieve\nthese levels. Figure 4 provides an illustrative example of domain-specific AN Level,\nwith a specific focus on the function map related to the domain-specific AN Level.\nCSPs need to determine whether they require a comprehensive and systematic\nevaluation or if a preliminary, more cursory assessment suffices. Systematic evaluation\ninvolves a comprehensive assessment of the autonomy level within a specific domain\nbased on domain-specific AN Level criteria. It entails comparing the existing state to\npredefined objectives and pinpointing any identified weaknesses and gaps. The\nfunction map serves as a valuable tool for strategizing and evolving system functions\naimed at enhancing weaknesses and closing gaps. For a rapid and preliminary\nassessment, a questionnaire is devised, based on the domain-specific AN Level. This\nquestionnaire enables participants to swiftly grasp the evaluation process and provide\na rough estimation of a Communication Service Provider's (CSP) autonomy level.\n© TM Forum 2024.

AN Target Architecture\nThe complete AN target architecture includes the architecture vision, AN framework,\narchitecture principles and technical reference architecture comprehensively defined by\nTM Forum, ETSI and domain-specific SDOs.\nTo define the Autonomous Network (AN) target architecture, CSPs can follow this\nstructured process:\n1. Establish the architectural vision and principles by drawing insights from\ncorporate strategic directives, business strategies, technical prerequisites,\narchitecture requirements, AN standards, and prevailing industry technology\ntrends.\n2. Articulate a functional architecture that aligns with corporate strategic goals,\ndrawing from AN's functional reference architecture and existing architectural\ncapabilities. This involves conducting process walk-throughs, identifying value\nstreams, and summarizing business capability requirements. Throughout this\nphase, CSPs should identify significant architecture gaps and provide essential\nimprovement recommendations. Operators should particularly emphasize two\nkey aspects: defining an efficient architectural division of labor to expedite\nservice innovation and reduce overall costs, and implementing formalized data\nand models to support hierarchical AI integration and closed-loop automation.\n3. Put architectural principles into practice in alignment with corporate\nstrategic objectives for specific business scenarios. Enhance business\ncapabilities based on assessments of AN Level and effectiveness.\n4. Continuously refine the target architecture in an iterative manner, drawing\ninsights from issues encountered during implementation.\n2.3.1. Conceptual architecture and principles\nThe TM Forum framework that members are building identifies three layers and four\nclosed loops to deliver Autonomous Networks (see Figure 5). The three layers are\ncommon capabilities of operations that can be utilized to support all scenarios and\nbusiness needs:\n1. Resource operations layer – provides automation of network resources and\ncapabilities in each autonomous domain level\n2. Service operations layer – provides the capabilities for IT services and\nnetwork planning, design, rollout, provisioning, assurance and optimization of\noperations across multiple autonomous domains\n3. Business operations layer – provides the capabilities for customer,\necosystem and partner business enabling and operations for AN services\n© TM Forum 2024. All Rights Reserved.

All Rights Reserved. Page 17 of 25\nIG1218F Autonomous Networks Framework v1.1.0\n2.3.2. AN Reference Architecture\nAutonomous networks aim to make processes more efficient and intelligent to better\nserve human needs and enhance overall decision-making. Achieving end-to-end\nautonomy requires collaboration across the industry. To handle the complexity of\nvarious services and technologies, TM Forum and other organizations have created\nstandards and workflows for seamless communication between different layers. TM\nForum's autonomous network reference architecture focuses on essential principles\nand patterns to improve Self-X capabilities, helping operators reach Levels 3 and 4 of\nautonomy ( IG1251 Autonomous Networks – Reference Architecture [2], Figure 6.)\nFigure 6. AN Reference Architecture (showing detailed ADs at all layers)\nTM Forum IG1251A [5] also presents the details of how technology specific SDOs\ncoordinate with each other on autonomous network architecture. The realizations build\non the core concepts of AN (defining closed loops, using intent-driven interfaces)\nenables the autonomy at various management scopes. Multiple realizations of different\nmanagement scopes are coordinated with each other and form an end-to-end AN\nsolution to achieve the overall AN vision.\n• Domain management: e.g., 3GPP SA5, ETSI F5G, IETF.\n• Cross-domain management: e.g., TM Forum AN, ETSI ZSM.\n2.4. AN Map\nThe shift towards network automation and intelligence is a complex transformation\ninvolving many organizations, diverse networks, and cooperation among different\noperators' platforms, systems, and devices from various vendors. In the past, network\nimprovements often focused on isolated innovations rather than a holistic view, mainly\ndue to factors like siloed (separate) departments and bottom-up approaches. This\napproach hindered the potential streamlining of end-to-end network processes and\nthus hinders AN achieving the stated objectives.\nTo this end, the Autonomous Network Map is a tool designed to help Communication\nService Providers (CSPs) set clear AN objectives and break them down\n© TM Forum 2024. All Rights Reserved. Page 18 of 25\nIG1218F Autonomous Networks Framework v1.1.0\ncomprehensively. It guides the direction and priority of capability development,\nidentifies the scope and order of AN planning and deployment, and as the \"map\"\nmatures it will act as a reference point for promoting AN efforts and successes.\n2.4.1. High-Value Scenarios\nTo start creating an AN Map, we first define the AN implementation scenarios. We\nutilize theories like value stream analysis, including TOGAF [12], to explore a set of 11\noperational flows for services and networks. We then integrate the operational flows\nwith service categories and network domains to establish the AN scenario framework,\nas depicted in Figure7, which can be used to define the AN high-value scenarios.\nFigure 7. Define AN high-value scenarios\n2.4.2. Prioritize the Scenarios\nThe AN scenario framework, as discussed in the previous section, defines a\ncomprehensive set of high-value implementation scenarios necessary for improving the\nAN level and ultimately attaining higher levels of autonomy from an end-to-end\nperspective. However, in practical application, multiple rounds of iteration and evolution\nare often necessary to make the most of limited resources and experience.\nHence, it is advisable to determine the priority of each AN high-value implementation\nscenario. This prioritization can be based on factors like the operator's service strategy,\ncurrent autonomy status, and trends in service/network changes, as illustrated in\nFigure 8.\n© TM Forum 2024. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 25\nIG1218F Autonomous Networks Framework v1.1.0\nFigure 8. Four-quadrant analysis method for prioritize scenarios\nThe four-quadrant analysis method as a recommendation for prioritizing scenarios can\nbe used to classify each high-level implementation scenario based on the assessment\nof business value and technology viability. Then the AN map is finally established, by\ngiving priority to high-value implementation scenarios, practitioners can effectively\nconcentrate limited resources to maximize the goal achievement within a single\niteration.

Autonomous Networks Practice\nAN operations practices involve two key components: AN Strategic Planning (ANSP)\nand AN Journey (refer to Figure 9).\nAN Strategic Planning serves as the overarching framework for CSPs (or subgroups\nwithin CSPs) to plot or chart their AN \"journey\". It includes corporate-level AN\nstrategies, executive commitments, guidance on implementing the four elements of the\nautonomous network blueprint, and outlines industry contributions and technological\ninnovation directions.\nThe AN Journey is an iterative process in which operators execute strategies to\nachieve their objectives.\nFigure 9. AN operations practices\nTo accelerate large-scale AN deployment, CSPs and their suppliers have devised a\nfour-step iterative process based on high-value scenarios. By following this process,\noperators can enhance their AN Level and effectiveness, and establish end-to-end\nservice and business closed loops.\n1. Assessment: for each high-value scenario, CSPs evaluate the live network\nbased on the AN Level and KEIs, establish baselines for domain-specific AN\nLevel and KEIs, and set improvement goals based on service requirements and\nthe investment plan.\n2. Gap analysis: CSPs analyze the gaps between the baselines and goal, identify\nthe root causes of breakpoints and weaknesses through process walk-through,\nbreak down the goal to achieve a higher AN Level and improve effectiveness,\nand formulate a key transformation item list.\n3. Solution design: based on the target architecture, CSPs convert capability\nrequirements into function requirements; design an application architecture;\ncategorize system functions; output process transformation requirements and\nfunction requirements for OSSs, OMCs, and NEs; create system development\nlists; and pilot solutions.\n4. Implementation: based on the system development list and pilot solutions,\nCSPs launch the solutions at opcos to facilitate the transition to production and\nreplication among more opcos to improve their AN Level and KEIs and achieve\nthe business goal.\n© TM Forum 2024.

(Note that Italicized terms in definition text point to other\nterms defined in this guide)\nTerm Abbreviation Definition / Source\nAutonomous AD An autonomous domain is a system (or set of\nDomain systems or agents) that is capable of autonomous\nbehavior (e.g., resolve tasks, adhere to objectives)\nwithout manual human intervention. The\nautonomous domain does this by realizing self-\nmanagement capabilities using closed control loop\nmechanisms, using four key phases: awareness,\nanalysis, decision-making, and execution. It is a\ndomain with an administrative governance\nboundary that defines the scope of encapsulated\nautonomous behaviors. (IG1230)\nAutonomous AN An Autonomous Network is a system of networks\nNetwork and software platforms that are capable of sensing\nits environment and adapting its behavior\naccordingly with little or no human input. (IG1230\nAN Technical Architecture).\nAN Level or ANL \"AN Levels describe the level of autonomic\nAutonomy capability in a given operational workflow or for an\nLevel autonomous domain (L0->L5). AN Levels identify\ncontextual autonomous capability\" (IG1230 AN\nTechnical Architecture).\nAN Levels are a linear scale, 0 through 5 indicating\nthe level of autonomy of an autonomous network or\nautonomous domain.\nEach level is described formally in IG 1218: \"\n- Level 0 - manual management: The system\ndelivers assisted monitoring capabilities,\nwhich means all dynamic tasks have to be\nexecuted manually.\n- Level 1 - assisted management: The system\nexecutes a certain repetitive sub-task based\non pre-configured to increase execution\nefficiency.\n- Level 2 - partial Autonomous Networks: The\nsystem enables partial automatic O&M for\ncertain units based on predefined rule/policy\nunder certain external environments.\n- Level 3 - conditional Autonomous\nNetworks: Building on L2 capabilities, the\nsystem with awareness can sense real-time\nenvironmental changes, and in certain\nnetwork domains, optimize and adjust itself to\nthe external environment.\n© TM Forum 2023.

The Level table provides a\ndetailed set of metrics that represent multiple\naspects of concerns, including control loop phase,\nand level of human machine interaction (HMI), that\nin combination,indicate a networks level of\nautonomy.\nClosed Loop CL A closed loop or closed loop system is one in\nwhich the output of the system is continuously\nmonitored and used to adjust the input in order to\nmaintain a desired output. This feedback can be\nused to make adjustments to the system\nautomatically, with little or no human\nintervention.(Paraphrased from IG1230). See also\nControl Loop.\nIn control theory, a closed loop system refers to a\nsystem in which the output of the system is used to\nprovide a feedback signal to control the input,\nwhereas in an open loop system, the control action\nis not dependent on the output of the system. The\nfeedback in a closed loop system can be used to\nadjust the input in order to bring the output closer\nto a desired state.\nIn the context of autonomous networks, closed\nloop refers to the same concept, where the\nautonomous system continually monitors the\noutput and compares it to the desired output,\nmaking necessary adjustments to the input in order\nto bring the output closer to the desired state.\nAutonomous systems are often closed loop\nsystems because they need to sense and respond\nto their environment to achieve their goals.\nIt's important to note that both definitions are\nsimilar in the sense that they both describe a\nfeedback mechanism. The difference is that the\ncontext of control theory can include various kind of\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 6 of 21\nIG1258 Autonomous Networks Glossary v1.0.0\nTerm Abbreviation Definition / Source\nsystems, while autonomous systems refer to a\nspecific class of systems which are self-governing,\nself-controlled and self-sustaining systems. To\nsimplify, closed loop in control theory describes the\ngeneral concept of a feedback mechanism while in\nautonomous systems it describes how these\nsystems respond and adapt to the environment to\nachieve their goals (see Autonomous Networks\ndefinition).\nClosed Loop CLA Closed Loop Automation (CLA) refers to a type of\nAutomation automation in which a system's output is\ncontinuously monitored, and any necessary\nadjustments are made to the system's input in\norder to maintain the desired output. In other\nwords, it is a system that receives feedback and\nuses it to adjust its actions. One example of closed\nloop automation within telecommunications is in\nthe context of network management. A system\ncould monitor the performance of a network, and\nadjust the configuration of the network in real-time\nto ensure optimal performance.\nIntent \"Intent is the formal specification of all expectations\nincluding requirements, goals, and constraints\ngiven to a technical system\" (TM Forum, 2022,\nIG1230 and later on IG1253).\n\"A set of operational goals that a network should\nmeet and outcomes that a network is supposed to\ndeliver, defined in a declarative manner without\nspecifying how to achieve or implement\nthem\" (IETF RFC9315, 2020).\nSee Section 4. Intent Terminology for more Intent\nrelated terms.\nSelf-X Self-X Self-X capabilities are a set of abilities that enable\nCapability an autonomous network to perform tasks (or\nSelf-*\nfunctions) without the need for human intervention.\nThese abilities include self-configuration, self-\ndiagnosis, self-healing, self-optimization, and self-\nprotection. Self-configuration allows the system to\nadapt its settings and parameters to changing\nenvironments and conditions. Self-diagnosis allows\nthe system to identify and diagnose problems. Self-\nhealing allows the system to recover from\nproblems and return to normal operation. Self-\noptimization allows the system to improve its\nperformance over time. Self-protection allows the\nsystem to defend against cyber-attacks and other\nsecurity threats.\n\"Self-operation (Self-X or Self-*) capabilities are\nthe main functions to support above business\nrequirements, which include self-serving (self-\n© TM Forum 2023.

See IG1218 for an analysis of\nthese capabilities in relation to achieving AN vision.\nTM Forum TIO The TM Forum Intent Ontology (TIO) is a\nIntent standardized ontology for defining and\nOntology representing the goals, constraints, and\nrequirements of autonomous networks (a.k.a\nintents!). It is developed and maintained by the TM\nForum, a global industry association that focuses\non digital transformation in the\ntelecommunications, media, and entertainment\nsectors.\nThe TIO provides a highly expressive vocabulary\nfor defining and representing the intents of\nautonomous systems, and for enabling systems to\ncommunicate and coordinate their actions with one\nanother. It is designed to be flexible and extensible,\nand can be used to represent the intentions of a\nwide variety of autonomous systems, including\nnetworks, resources, services, and applications.\nThe TIO is intended to support the development\nand deployment of autonomous networks by\nproviding a standardized way to define and\nrepresent the requirements of these systems. It is\nalso intended to facilitate the development of tools\nand techniques for managing and optimizing the\nperformance of autonomous systems, and to\nsupport the interoperability of these systems with\none another.\nZero-X Zero-X Zero-touch, zero-trouble, and zero-wait\nExperience experiences (referred to as zero-X or zero-* for\nZero-*\nshort) are design principles that aim to create\ncustomer experiences that are effortless and\nseamless.\n\"Zero-touch\" refers to the idea of designing a\nsystem or process that requires minimal or no\neffort on the part of the customer to use. This could\ninvolve automating certain tasks or making it easy\nfor customers to find the information or assistance\nthey need without having to contact customer\nservice.\n\"Zero-trouble\" refers to the idea of designing a\nsystem or process that causes minimal or no\ninconvenience or frustration for the customer.

Autonomy versus Automation\nTerm Formal Definition Source\nAutonomy The capability to make decisions free from human TM Forum\ncontrol. (IG1230)\nAutonomous Having autonomy. (adjective) (IG1230) TM Forum\nAutonomic Acting or occurring involuntarily (Meriam-Webster Dictionary\nDictionary).\nResulting from internal stimuli; spontaneous (The Free\nDictionary)\nAutonomicity Autonomicity is the ability of a system to exhibits the IEEE paper\nfour key objective properties of autonomic systems:\nDictionary\nself-configuring, self-optimizing, self-healing, and self-\nprotecting - together with the attribute properties, viz.,\nself-aware, environment-aware, self-monitoring, and\nself-adjusting (not precise or formal definition).\nThe quality of having autonomic capability (adjective).\nAutomated made to operate by machines or computers in order to Dictionary\nreduce the work done by humans (Cambridge\ndictionary)\nAutomation the use of machines and computers that can operate Dictionary\nwithout needing human control\nAutomatic Able to operate independently of human control TM Forum,\n(IG1230) Cambridge\nDictionary\nAutonomy means to be independent or to be able to control or govern oneself. It is\ndifferent from automation, which performs a sequence of highly structured pre-\nprogrammed tasks requiring human oversight and intervention. Intelligent autonomy is\nwhere operations have learning and adaptive capabilities that allow responses with\nminimal human interaction, empowering operators to perform higher-level optimization\ntasks.\nAutonomous is an adjective that describes something that is self-governed, self-\ndirected, or self-controlled. It typically refers to things that are able to function\nindependently, without the need for external guidance or direction. In the context of\ntechnology, autonomous systems are those that are able to make their own decisions\nand take action based on their own internal rules and procedures, rather than being\ncontrolled by a human operator or external system.\nThe terms autonomic, autonomy, autonomous and autonomicity have been used\nin various fields such as language, biology, and philosophy. In general, the term\nautonomic implies occurring involuntarily, unconsciously, or automatically, or resulting\nspontaneously from internal causes such as autonomic reflexes. The term\nautonomous comes from ancient Greek in the sixteenth century and means having its\nown laws. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, autonomous means the capacity\nfor self-governance or having the freedom to act independently, which also means self-\ncontainment and self-direction. Autonomicity refers to the state of being autonomic.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 10 of 21\nIG1258 Autonomous Networks Glossary v1.0.0\nThe term autonomic computing was named after the human body's autonomic nervous\nsystem of the human body which is responsible for the human body perceiving,\nadapting to, and interacting with the world in order to manage dynamically changing\nand unpredictable circumstances.(Source Kephart, J.O.; Chess, D.M.

Most of\nthe source definitions are taken from IG1230 Autonomous Networks Technical\nArchitecture.\nTerm Definition / Source\nAADE Loop The AADE loop is a closed control loop that is used to guide the\ndesign and implementation of autonomous systems. AADE stands\nfor Awareness, Analysis, Decision and Execution. The AADE loop\nis an iterative process that involves the following steps:\n1. Awareness: In this step, the AN system gathers data and\ninformation from various sources, such as sensors,\ndatabases, and user input.\n2. Analysis: In this step, the AN system processes and\nanalyzes the data to identify patterns, trends, and\nrelationships.\n3. Decision : In this step, the AN system uses the insights\ngained from the analysis to decide on a solution or course\nof action.\n4. Execution: In this step, the AN system executes, tests and\nevaluates the effectiveness of the solution or course of\naction, and adjusts it as needed based on the results of the\nevaluation.\nThe AADE loop is an ongoing process that is repeated as needed\nto continuously improve the performance of the Autonomous\nNetwork (AN). It is similar to another AADE Loop (Acquire,\nAnalyze, Design, and Evaluate) described in the field of AI\nsystems.\nNote that sometimes the term Perception is used interchangeably\nwith Awareness. Note also that other telecom standards use a\nsimilarly defined loop that also have their basis in MAPE-K such\nas CADE Loop from ETSI ZSM, where C is for (data) Collection\nrather than Awareness and the MADE Loop from 3GPP where M\nstands for Monitor rather than Awareness.\nAgent An agent is an intelligent entity that runs independently, acts by\nitself, is affected by external environments, continuously detects\nfrom the environment to improve its capabilities, and combines\ninference and knowledge representation. An agent has the\ncharacteristics of autonomy, reactivity, adaptability,\ncommunication, and self-learning. Agents can be software agents,\nhardware agents, firmware agents, robotic agents, human agents,\nand so on.\nAN Reference Defines a set of architectural ‘building blocks’ that form the self-\nArchitecture management capabilities underpinning autonomous platforms and\nsystems. Identifies the formal architecture of AN and the 9\nreference points I1-3,F1-3 and K1-3. (IG1251)\nAutonomous An autonomous agent is an autonomous individual that can adapt\nAgent to and interact with its environment. (see Agent)\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 12 of 21\nIG1258 Autonomous Networks Glossary v1.0.0\nTerm Definition / Source\nAutonomous \"A system that is capable of performing the functions of sensing,\nSystem thinking, and acting in the environment without human\nintervention.\" (ISO)\n\"An autonomous system is a system that can operate without\nhuman intervention and can make decisions on its own based on\nits programming and sensory input.\" (IEEE)\nControl Loop A control loop is a type of control system that is used to regulate a\nprocess or system by continuously monitoring and adjusting its\ninput in order to maintain a desired output. Control loops are used\nin a wide range of applications, such as industrial automation,\nautomotive systems, aerospace, and telecommunications. Control\nloops can also be classified as open loop and closed loop control\nsystems. Open loop control systems do not have any feedback\nmechanism, while closed loop control systems have a feedback\nmechanism.\n\"Control loops are used to enable autonomous systems to adapt\ntheir behavior to respond to changes in user needs, business\ngoals, or environmental conditions. A closed control loop also\nrefers to an autonomous system accomplishing a task without a\nhuman taking an active role during task execution\" ( from IG1230)\nSee also Closed Loop.\nDomain A domain is a subset of a specific management area. (See\nTMF071 ODF Glossary for further definitions of 'domain' concepts)\nExplainability Explainability is the extent to which the internal mechanics of a\nmachine or deep learning system can be explained in human\nterms (IG1230) (Sometimes confused with\nInterpretability) Interpretability is about being able to discern the\nmechanics without necessarily knowing why. Explainability is\nbeing able to quite literally explain what is happening. An\nexplanation is the answer to a why-question (Miller 2017).\nHuman-in-the- Human-in-the-loop (HITL) refers to a closed control loop where\nLoop (HITL) humans are actively involved in the decision-making process and\nare able to intervene and make decisions in real time as needed.\nThis approach is often used in systems where there is a high level\nof uncertainty or complexity, and where the system needs to be\nable to adapt and respond to changing conditions in real time. A\nHuman-in-the-loop (HITL) example is an air traffic control system,\nin which human controllers are responsible for making real-time\ndecisions about the movement and routing of aircraft based on\ninput from automated systems.\nHuman-on-the- Human-on-the-loop (HOTL) refers to closed control loops where\nLoop (HOTL) humans are not actively involved in the decision-making process\nbut are able to review and override decisions made by the system\nas needed. This approach is often used in systems where there is\na lower level of uncertainty or complexity, and where the system is\nable to make decisions based on predetermined criteria or rules.\nA Human-on-the-loop (HOTL) example is an automated trading\nsystem, in which human traders are able to review and override\ntrades made by the system based on predetermined criteria. In the\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 21\nIG1258 Autonomous Networks Glossary v1.0.0\nTerm Definition / Source\ncontext of autonomous systems, \"Human-on-the-loop\" typically\nrefers to humans playing a more supervisory role, monitoring the\ndecisions and actions taken by the autonomous system and\npotentially intervening if necessary.\nInterpretability Interpretability is about the extent to which a cause and effect can\nbe observed within a system (IG1230). Interpretable Machine\nLearning refers to methods and models that make the behavior\nand predictions of machine learning systems understandable to\nhumans. Book: Interpretable Machine Learning, Christoph Molnar,\n2022-12-14\nMachine Machine Learning is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence which\nLearning (ML) focuses on using data and algorithms to imitate the way humans\nlearn. Algorithms \"learn\" to make classifications or predictions\nwithout being explicitly programmed from training data input to the\nmachine learning model. The model can then be evaluated for\naccuracy with data that was withheld from the training set. Human\nprogrammers can alter the model for more accurate results, for\nexample by changing the initial parameters of the model and re-\ntraining.\nMachine \"Machine reasoning is the ability of a computer or machine to\nReasoning perform tasks that require logical and analytical thinking, such as\n(MR) problem-solving, decision-making, and planning. It involves the\nuse of algorithms and logical rules to process and analyze data,\nand to draw conclusions or make decisions based on that\nanalysis. Machine reasoning is a key component of artificial\nintelligence and is used in a wide range of applications, including\nnatural language processing, image and speech recognition, and\ndecision support systems.\" (Arshdeep, et al. \"A Review on\nReasoning Techniques in Artificial Intelligence.\" International\nJournal of Computer Applications, vol. 168, no. 9, 2017, p. 34.)\nManagement Management Domain is a grouping of Managed Entities that\nDomain (MD) partitions the managed objects into logical groups and defines a\ncommon administrative domain for managing the objects within it.\n(Paraphrased from TM Forum's GB922 \"SID Root Entities\" and\nTR275 \"Core Networking Resources Business Entities\")\n\"Scope of management that federates together management\nservices, that enables their exposure towards external service\nconsumers and that is delineated by a business, administrative,\ntechnological or other boundary (ETSI ZSM007 Terminology)\nManagement \"Logical entity playing the roles of service consumer and/or\nFunction (MnF) service producer\" (ETSI ZSM007 Terminology)\nSee Intent Management Function.\nManagement \"Set of offered management capabilities\" (ETSI ZSM007\nService (MnS) Terminology).

Intent extension models can add additional\ncapabilities or functionality to an intent common model (defined in\nTIO), or to augment the existing model's performance in some\nway, e.g., add some extra expressiveness. There are several ways\nthat intent extension models can be used. For example, they can\nbe used to add domain-specific knowledge or expertise to a model,\nto enable the model to handle a wider range of input data or\nscenarios, or to improve the model's performance on a particular\ntask or problem (Source: TM Forum AN Project)\nIntent Handler \"The intent handler is the role given to the receiver of an intent\nobject from an intent owner. An intent handler considers the\nrequirements, goals and constraints specified in this intent object\nwhen operating the domain and infrastructure it is responsible for.\nThe intent manager in the role of intent handler is responsible to\ntransition the system state to a state that complies with the intent's\nexpectations.

An intent\nmanagement function can assume only one of these roles for a\ngiven intent. As such, an individual intent has only one owner and\none handler. However, a given intent management function playing\nthe role of intent owner for several intents can at the same time be\nthe intent handler for a different set of intents.\nIntent Management Function is the TM Forum's preferred term for\nthe function for intent-driven management, and it directly\nreferences the \"Management Function\" term defined externally by\nETSI ZSM and 3GPP SA5.\nSynonyms: Intent Handling Function, Intent Management Element ,\nSee Intent Handler (role). Intent Management Element (IME) term\nis used in ETSI ISG ZSM ZSM011.\nIntent Intent negotiation is the process of resolving conflicts or\nNegotiation discrepancies between intents of multiple parties or systems. It\ninvolves exchange of information and compromise to reach an\nagreement. In autonomous networks, it is used when multiple\ndomains or agents have conflicting intents and need to find a\nmutually acceptable solution. Negotiation can involve the use of\ndifferent negotiation strategies, such as making concessions or\nproposing alternative solutions to influence the intent owner's\nrequirements.

This has shifted\nthe focus of value to the management and operations of the networks and\ninfrastructure supporting the business. Management and operations bottlenecks are\nseen as the primary frontier to manage business value, and to do so, means to assess\nkey performance requirements that support the delivery of business outcome(s).\nExecuting digital transformation strategies to grow business continues to actively\nexplore methods to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of management and\noperations capabilities. Measuring and improving, as part of management of\norganizational capabilities, processes and/or targeted outcomes is a significant\nundertaking amidst the growing complexity in technology, sophisticated expectations of\ncustomers and the skills required to bring it altogether.\nEnterprises are inundated with many assessment and maturity models, and where a\nmodel is applied voluntarily towards evaluation of performance, enterprises aren't\nconfident how to match assessment outcomes with business value. The question of\nutilizing the right model to identify value proposition-delivery across all management\nand operations is a requirement to fill the gap left with specific models. Also, the\nproposition of specific models is key for organizations that are advanced and seeking\nassessment tools that offer surgical treatment of specific identified capability concerns.\nAutonomous Operations Maturity Model (AOMM) brings a unique approach to\nperformance assessment by applying a maturity grid assessment framework that is\nunderscored by the TM Forum's DMM, as well as input from other capability\nassessment models. AOMM maturity grid assessment framework uses learnings from\nthe different maturity model types, their focal points, and their attribution to \"levels of\nmaturity\" to establish taxonomy, assessment dimensions and level criteria for when an\norganization is planning/adopting or executing autonomous operations initiative.\nAOMM is leveraging the hybrid of a process-, capability- and outcome- based\napproach to define its assessment framework. The assessment framework is\nformulated to describe characteristics of implemented processes, autonomy\ncapabilities, behaviors and outcomes. This approach is to provide organizations with a\nbest practice assessment framework and methodology that enables take advantage of\nstrategies for AO by assessing AS-IS capabilities and behaviors, and setting targets\nacross the core, supporting and enabling business domains.\nWith are over sixty maturity models out there for service providers to use, AOMM is\nfocused on autonomous operations and helps members to navigate AO initiatives,\nbenchmark business investments with outcomes, and to understand and effectively\nimplement performance insights into operations capability gaps.\nUnder the Autonomous Operations initiative, AOMM is established to make sense of all\nthe existing maturity models, such as Digital Maturity Model (DMM), Customer\nExperience Maturity Model (CEMM), Autonomous Network Levels (ANL), Data\nGovernance Maturity Model, Closed Loop Automation Maturity Model (CAMM) etc.,\nand provide a model that leverages across these existing models, characteristics that\napply to improving autonomous operations project/program assessment and steering.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Introduction\nAutonomy, the right to self-governance, and bounded regions possessing the freedom\nto govern themselves have become new information and communications technology\nobjectives for automation. The term, however, is used in the MAMA project to equally\nbring into context a management and operations dimension to an enterprise’s\nbusiness. In the context of the enterprises business, it addresses all the underlying\ncapabilities, and behaviors about how such capabilities and behaviors result in better\ncontrol and coordination of business activities and of course outcomes that enable\nrealize business value.\nFigure 1. Contexts bounding autonomy in ICT realm\nAutonomous Operations is a realization of business operations for zero-touch\noperations. As time progresses, operations, and maintenance (O&M) procedures\nevolve in complexity due to introduction of new technologies, need to realize better\ncustomer value delivery and the ramifications on organization and skills. This is\nresulting in long cycle-times, negative customer experience and operating costs.\nExperience by members providing managed services, system integration and\noperational consulting show rising cost in handling trouble tickets based. The negative\nimpact on customer experience is driving members to become more responsive to the\nuse of automation to eliminate the negative trends in business operations.\nBy embracing initiatives and projects in Autonomous Operations, service providers are\nable to establish new business targets that positively affect customer experience and\ndirectly improve top-line and bottom line. Service providers establishing bold projects\nunder the autonomous operations ambition integrate proactive prevention and closed\nloop automation capabilities into their business. These carriers are now able to\nautomatically predict operational concerns in advance, and pre-emptively act with little\nor no-human interventions.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved.

TM Forum Autonomous Operations initiative\nAutonomous Operations Maturity Model (AOMM) supports AO project sponsorship and\nmanagement to understand process improvements, performance improvements and\nbehavioral characteristics relevant for a successful AO initiative. AOMM provides an\nenterprise with a structure to assess as-is AO processes, capabilities, and outcomes,\nand enables define goals and improvement targets anchored on business value. By\ncombining capability maturity models with maturity grids, a balance is arrived at\nbetween being prescriptive and descriptive about the organization’s intent.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 7 of 25\nGB1042 Autonomous Operations Maturity Model v1.0.0\n2. Maturity in Autonomous Operations\nEvolution of operations practices stem at inherent concerns and failures of current\npractices in the enterprises' ability to manage day-to-day business to align with growth\nor market trends, or challenges in engagements with suppliers and partners for\n\"managed services\" and traditional outsourcing (ITO, Network Outsourcing etc.). Hints\nto failures include:\n• Poor objectives and analysis defined from onset -\n• Poor definition of expected mandates\n• Poor sense of partnership - lack of follow-through with contracts,\n• Poor service transition -\n• Poor adoption of \"claimed\" services - pricing model for managed services is not\nable to reflect the ongoing state of the enterprise as the business experiences\nvolatile growth.\nTransitioning from traditional managed services and outsourcing engagements to\nAutonomous Operations implies an evolution in the measures, value propositions and\noperating models.\nFigure 3. Evolving to outcome-based engagement and operating models\nThe following characteristics in IG1301 have been identified to help guide the selection\nand correlation of autonomous operations assessment against performance metrics.\nThese qualitative characteristics can be managed through the assessment model of\nAOMM in order to position quantitative measures. The characteristics are recapped\nhere as including:\n• Desirability: measurements collected are required for the design or operation\n• Feasibility: measurements have to be collected as often as desired\n• Validity: measurements and their evaluations need to be checked for\ncorrectness\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 8 of 25\nGB1042 Autonomous Operations Maturity Model v1.0.0\n• Viability: measurements being collected can clearly provide the measurable\nbenefits\n• Robustness: measurement quality must not be affected by changing conditions\n• Accuracy: measurement errors and biases need to be within acceptable limits\n• Efficiency: measurements should not consume too much of the system\nresource\nThese characteristics are reflected in the AOMM dimensions and in creating the criteria\nstatements. Altogether with the quantitative measures defined based on the value\nstreams, they help to address the different business domains based and reflect the\nimplication defined in the guidelines in GB1040 for defining, improving, or enhancing\nmetrics.\n2.1. Background\nAutonomy through hyperautomation is characterized by three key dimensions\n(reference Figure 1): (1) level of automation (end-point based or end-to-end), (2)\nadaptability in behavior (not adaptive to adaptive); and (3) dimension to governance\n(by self, through other, or by other). TM Forum in the management and operations\nrealm positions 'autonomous operations' as an initiative that enables end-to-end\nautomation to achieve zero-touch operations. This covers the redesigning of operations\nto leverage AI (at scale), self-healing network domains, and the operating models\nemerging with the advent of 5G, Cloud, AI and Edge Computing.\nThe rapid evolution in management and operations practices is trickling down to\nservice engagement and operating models. Past successes and lessons learned from\nmanaging operations since the era of assisted operations, through managed services\nto end-to-end full outsourcing engagement, it is clear, where adaptability and\ngovernance lacked sound basis, these engagements failed. Lessons from across the\nglobe have hinted on lack of agility and flexibility on the side of engaging parties to\nindependently and collectively realize value. Autonomous Operations is changing the\nparadigm with the adoption of new technologies for closed loop management and\nrequirement/goals management to deliver a zero-touch operations ambition where the\nmodel of engagement with use of these technologies facilitates better means to\nachieve enterprise responsiveness, business agility, and improve quality of confidence\nin driving returns on investments.\n2.2. Origins\nAutonomous Operations Maturity Model is born out of the cumulative work done in TM\nForum Digital Maturity Model project, Digital Organization Transformation project\n(DOT) Customer Experience Maturity Model project and ongoing work on AI-Closed\nLoop Automation, Autonomous Network Levels and Culture Maturity Model, amongst\nothers. This model is structured to enable harness value of improving a set of\ncapabilities that enable drive business outcomes and supported business value when\nusing the MAMA Framework.\nTo manage the definition and adoption of Autonomous Operations as a collection of\ncapabilities to drive enterprise operations and operational management, AOMM\nascribes levels, dimensions and assessment criteria for the capabilities that establish a\nset of predetermined behavioral patterns of an enterprise or enterprise functions\n© TM Forum 2023.

Some parallels along these lines can be\nascribed to a modern enterprise having the capability to change suppliers in its supply\nchain management strategy at a fast rate to integrate new resources to cover a gap in\nshortages of another supplier (Case: Tesla Works with suppliers to source alternative\nchips amid semiconductor shortage, Apple, AMD navigate chip shortage with focus on\nprofitable products). The capabilities underpinning these organizations dexterity to be\nswift, responsive and agile to respond to both market forces and consumer demand\ncan largely be attributed to their autonomous operations' ability.\nIn the service provider arena, with particular emphasis on the Communications Service\nProviders, operations and operational management needs must factor in business\noutcomes as the cornerstone to drive the business value targets. Operations\nmanagement with use automation of value fabrics, value chains and value streams that\nare adaptive and self-governing bring resilience to the enterprises business - amidst\nmarket forces and helps us to defend and grow margins/profits.\n2.3.

Taxonomy of Autonomous Operations Maturity Model\nAdded context on the levels\n• Level 0: ZERO\nThis taxonomy has been included to enable setting a baseline for assessing any\nfunction, organization or groups of organizations. It enables set a tone for non-\nexistence of this novel concept of autonomy-backed technology and business\noperations concepts, behaviors, and capabilities as a new and emerging foundation,\nand thus not every organization may be including this in their strategy.\n• Level 1: INITIATING\nIn Level 1, \"initiating\", the taxonomy identifies the effort an organization or\nenterprises is making towards incorporating autonomy-backed technology and\nbusiness operations concepts, behaviors and capabilities into the business. It\nrecognizes the existence of an early stage formulation of autonomy-backed\ntechnology and business operations concepts, behaviors and capabilities in the\nenterprise.\n• Level 2: EMERGING\nIn Level 2, \"emerging\", the taxonomy recognizes isolated cases of ongoing\nimplementation of autonomy-backed technology and business operations concepts,\nbehaviors and capabilities into specific parts of the enterprise’s operations, and the\nlinkage to identified business outcomes and then to business value. There is also\nrecognition by the organization of improvements needed, and plans conceived\nand/or in place to realize such improvements.\n• Level 3. PERFORMING\nIn Level 3, \"performing\", the taxonomy recognizes the coordinated and\nimplementation of innovative approaches to autonomy-backed technology and\nbusiness operations concepts, behavior and capabilities, and how this is executed\nacross multiple parts/areas/groups/functions of the enterprise. There is also the\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 25\nGB1042 Autonomous Operations Maturity Model v1.0.0\nimplementation of ongoing expansion and improvements of the approach to\nautonomy-backed technology and business operations concepts, behaviors and\ncapabilities to achieve scale and scope of business outcomes to support business\nvalue.\n• Level 4. ADVANCING\nIn Level 4, \"advancing\", the taxonomy recognizes a coherent organization-wide\nimplementation of autonomy-backed technology and operations concepts, behavior\nand capabilities across the enterprise and using them to achieve competitive\nadvantage.\n• Level 5. LEADING\nIn level 5, \"leading\", the taxonomy recognizes a best-in-class autonomy-backed\ntechnology and business operations concepts, behavior and capabilities embedded\nas a part of the enterprise and with ecosystem partners and by doing so leveraging\nits achievement to drive leadership of best practices, standards and advancement of\nautonomous operations adoptions.\nWith the maturation of autonomous operations concepts, technology, behavior and\ncapabilities, this taxonomy will be enhanced or optimized to meet the needs of the\nindustry.\n3.3. Dimensions of Assessment\nThe dimensions of assessment juxtapose the three definitive dimensions of assessing\nautonomous operations with the autonomous operations levels taxonomy to identify\nand attribute the embodying behaviors and capabilities at each level for each\ndimension. This will be further reviewed to enable arrive at a more informative set of\ndescriptions while ensuring mutual exclusivity and comprehensively exhaustive\nprinciple for dimension, level, and criteria definition.\nTable 1.

Key Assessment Criteria formulation\nstrategy\nSix assessment criteria formulation approaches have been analyzed to determine and\ndrive the evolution of AOMM with backward compatibility at all times. These six types,\nincluding diagnostic criteria, formative criteria, summative criteria, ipsative criteria,\nnorm-referenced criteria and criterion-referenced criteria each play a specific role in\nidentifying and attributing assessment scores to enterprises or service delivery\nfunctions exhibiting autonomous operations' behavior.\nIn the effort of TM Forum members to make the assessment criteria valid, reliable,\nequitable, explicit and transparent to support cross-validation and cross-pollination of\nexperience, most importantly be efficient tool to provide interpretative information about\noutcomes of investments to stakeholders, criteria are formulated to provide diagnostic\ninsights on the steps that must be taken to deliver value of change and/or adaptation in\noperations that realize business value.\n• Diagnostic criteria are formulated to identify information needed to understand\nknowledge of and capabilities of autonomous operations to enable assessors\nbetter the engagement for autonomous operations. E.g., What is your level of\nunderstanding of Closed Loop automation? Or What is your level of\nunderstanding of Intent Based Networking? Diagnostic criteria are used to\nidentify and segment assesses providing visibility and insights into the\norganizations AO initiatives.\n• Formative criteria help to optimize the basis for improving and benchmarking\nMAMA framework. It helps to align the business outcomes to the AOMM's\ncriteria statements by processing facts, adjusting assumptions, and drawing\nnuanced conclusions. Meaningful adoption of technologies, processes re-\nengineering and culture change does not always imply the enterprise has the\ncapability to impact business outcomes and change over time. Formative\ncriteria help to track progress where AOMM assessments are done periodically.\n• Summative criteria help to assess the enterprises' ability to learn and adapt\nprogress towards achieving autonomous operations based on specific AO\nstrategic initiative.\n• Ipsative criteria are formulated to ascertain the attitude of the organization\ntowards autonomous operations and autonomy concepts. E.g., The\norganization has improved maintenance management using AI-agents to\noperate and manage spares and spares allocation.\n• Norm-references criteria are designed to enable benchmark objectively given a\nset of supporting standards that are adjusted periodically. E.g., Is use of AI in\nClosed Loop Management based on TM Forum standards r2022 or r2023; or Is\nadoption of Intent Based Networking based on TM Forum common ontology\nversions or domain specific ontology like 3GPP etc.\n• Criterion-referenced criteria are formulated to compare performance against an\nindustry defined AO performance standard.\n© TM Forum 2023.

Related Models & Levels\nRelated models and maturity levels/scales that are linked with Autonomous Operations\nMaturity Model include:\n• DMM (Digital Maturity Model – GB997A) – This is the overarching master\nmaturity model of TM Forum which represents a strategic decision of an\norganization to use or apply digital transformation to their business.\n• CEMMM (Customer Experience Management Maturity Model - GB962B) - This\nis the customer experience maturity model which provides a surgical\nassessment framework of an organization's customer experience\ncenteredness.\n• AI & DA MM (Artificial Intelligence & Data Analytics Maturity Model – GB1003) -\nThis is the AI maturity model which focuses on requirement to support and use\nAI to deliver business outcomes.\n• RAMM (Revenue Assurance Maturity Model – GB941B) - This maturity model\nfocuses on the field of revenue assurance and necessary capabilities and focus\nfor driving improvement in revenue assurance.\n• FMMM (Fraud Management Maturity Model – GB969A) – This is laid out as a\nquestionnaire with 38 criteria across 4 subdimensions, each with a ‘Yes’ or ‘No’\ntype of answer\n• SCMM (Smart City Maturity Model – TR259) – This consists of a set of Survey\nstatements across 5 dimensions\n• Omni Channel Maturity Model – part of the Omnichannel Guidebook – GB994 -\nThis is focused on multichannel use strategies and the interlock needed to\ndeliver seamless multichannel establishment and management.\n• BDA (Big Data Analytics Solution Suite – GB979) – This maturity model lays out\na set of questions with 89 criteria across 10 dimensions, each with a ‘Yes’ or\n‘No’ type of answer to understand an organizations big data analytics solution\ncapability.\n• DGMM (Data Governance Maturity Model – GB1025) – This maturity model is\ndelivered in a wiki format, It consists of 7 criteria defined across three\nperspectives: Process, People and Technology.\n• EMM (Ecosystem Business Maturity Model - GB1001) - Still a work in progress\nmaturity model, it provides a set of criteria and dimensions around how well and\nhealthy an organization's ecosystem is. It is evolving to provide an assessment\nof ecosystems towards assuring their value fabric.\n• ANLEM (Autonomous Network Levels Evaluation Methodology – IG1252) - This\nis the Autonomous Network levels of maturity.\n• CMM (Culture Maturity Model – GB1019) - This is the culture maturity\nassessment model that focuses on the people and organization side to\nsuccessful and sustainable business.\n• DOT (Digital Organization Transformation) Framework - Is a framework more\nthan a model that ties together DMM with CMM and other sets of tools to\nprovide diagnostics and troubleshooting of the organization practicing or\ninvesting into any digital transformation initiative.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 18 of 25\nGB1042 Autonomous Operations Maturity Model v1.0.0\nAll these models provide some value proposition into AOMM. In future work further\ndetails on the leverage into AOMM, along with the specific aspects of AOMM will be\ndefined.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 25\nGB1042 Autonomous Operations Maturity Model v1.0.0\n6. Use\nA good maturity model serves as a tool that the organization or practitioner can use to\nmeasure how well their business or project or set of capabilities are doing, and how\ncapable they are of continuous development. AOMM applies the same goal to define\nand evaluate the attributes representative of \"autonomy\" applied to the enterprise’s\n\"operations\". It is meant as one of the tools in the organizations' arsenal to consistently\nand continuously contribute to achieve the business value set out when investments\ninto AO strategic initiative are planned. It will support AN's operations, AI-CLA\noperations, AI-Ops and other AO strategic initiatives to emerge in the future.\nThe trap with maturity models is the misunderstanding the role that a maturity model\nplays, and what can be expected from the use of one. Every maturity model, by itself,\ndoes not ensure organizational improvement. It is an assessment yardstick, an\nindicator of progress, but not the outcome. A maturity model can help to identify\nweaknesses, but not fix them. The results of an assessment against a maturity model\ncan help generate an improvement plan, but not execute the plan. It is therefore\nimportant to understand the role of AO Maturity Model and to ensure it is carried out\nthrough the AO Strategic initiatives, as well as communicating this within the MAMA\nFramework.\nFor an organization that undertakes the initiative of using any maturity model, the work\ndoes not end once the assessment is complete. Although it is true that an organization\nmay have had a goal of achieving a particular level on the chosen model, and that may\ngive cause for celebration, the level needs to match its expected business outcome\nand attributable business value. AOMM is not meant to be used as a project, or as\nmuch as a program. At this time, the model is being defined to enable capture essential\ncharacteristics that can enable define clearly what autonomous operations means to\nthe industry, and most importantly to the drive for business value improvement in the\nwake of new digital technologies, increasing customer experience expectations and\nbusiness growth beyond connectivity.\nOrganizations embracing an ongoing process of assessments, analysis, improvement\nplans, etc. will use AOMM to help inform the decision they make in pursuit of higher\nlevels. It is noteworthy that the model does not promote the need to drive higher levels\nof AOMM at cost of implementation that does not return the needed value. It is the\nreason AOMM is to be used closely with the other modules in the MAMA framework,\nsuch as Value Realization Framework and Value Model and to understand clearly what\na level means to the business.\nThe model is also not meant to be a stringent model. It is availed as a baseline for TM\nForum members, and industry practitioners to update/upgrade as the industry matures\naround AO, as well as customizable to meet specific needs of an AO strategic initiative.\nThe organization’s goals, strategy, mission and vision are important influences in the\nadoption, use and extension of AOMM. These elements are subject to change, making\nthe model subject to change.\n© TM Forum 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 20 of 25\nGB1042 Autonomous Operations Maturity Model v1.0.0\n7.
