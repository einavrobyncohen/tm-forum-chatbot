        "Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0 2. Challenges of Large-scale Realization As an increasing number of CSPs plan and deploy ANs, challenges are surfacing. ’s Autonomous Networks White Paper 3.0 identified six main challenges and offered ideas to address them. But new problems keep emerging, so the six challenges have been expanded in 2022 as follows: 1. How to measure the business value and O&M effectiveness of ANs? Can L3 or L4 ANs help CSPs provide new services and expand the digital",
        "markets in various industries? How can L3 or L4 improve service quality and experience? What benefits can L3 or L4 offer to improve network resource usage, lower O&M costs and improve O&M efficiency? These key problems need to be considered when carriers formulate AN strategies and evolution paths. 2. How to implement a level-based autonomous closed loop and finally enable agile services and business closed loops? The implementation of ANs requires cross-layer collaboration between networks and operations",
        "systems, and cross-domain streamlining of core, bearer, transport and wireless domains. How can CSPs develop autonomous capabilities from bottom to top and implement a level-based autonomous closed loop? How can they quickly integrate underlying capabilities to enable agile services? How can they facilitate AN construction based on business value in a top-down manner to achieve a business closed loop? These problems are yet to be resolved by CSPs. 3. How to develop the L4 target profile for each",
        "network domain and set the evolution path? What is the L4 target profile of each network domain? What new digital services, business models and service capabilities can be provided? What are the technical features? What is the target architecture? What specific technical capabilities need to be developed? What new operations changes will emerge? What are the evolution paths and how to select them? These are the questions to be answered by CXOs of CSPs and all industry partners. 4. How to deploy full-stack",
        "AI and leverage the collaboration between cloud- based centralized AI and network-based distributed AI? Introducing AI to communications networks in order to upgrade highly complex networks to ultra-intelligent systems has become the industry consensus. However, what is the target architecture for ultra-intelligent systems? Is it a centralized ultra-intelligent brain that commands the entire network? Or is it an efficient and collaborative distributed cerebellum? How will CSPs deploy full-stack AI",
        "in a coordinated manner? How can they leverage the collaboration between cloud AI and distributed AI? The entire industry needs to jointly explore these questions and find win-win answers. 5. How to enable industry partners to collaborate and innovate, build a healthy ecosystem, and upgrade and evolve at the same time? The implementation of ANs involves theoretical research and technological breakthroughs in multiple sectors including communications, IT, AI and automation. Many concepts and technologies",
        "are still being defined and verified. How can the positioning and collaboration of all parties be standardized? How will the sectors strike a balance between return on investment and developing cutting- edge technologies? How to design a schedule for upgrades and evolution is a challenge that must be overcome. 6. How to establish process mechanisms and develop skills for ANs? Tremendous efforts have been made to use machines to equip employees with O&M capabilities and transform the troubleshooting",
        "mode from ticket forwarding, which is a long process, to device self-healing or one-hop closed-loop processing. How will CSPs upgrade employees’ skills to implement automatic and intelligent © 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 12 of 105 IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0 O&M? How will they inject O&M knowledge, train, and supervise machines in a low-code manner? Answering these questions is key to the successful implementation of ANs. 7. How to establish unified evaluation standards?",
        "Many CSPs and suppliers have been working on the objectives of L3 and L4 autonomous capabilities. However, due to different methods of evaluation, multiple evaluation scopes and varying degrees of understanding, it is difficult to compare and evaluate the ANL of industry players. Therefore, it becomes necessary to jointly define unified evaluation standards. 8. How to perform systematic planning and deployment? It is challenging for CSPs to perform ANL evaluation on all products, services and domains.",
        "Plus they must correlate standards at the domain level and promote cloud network operations autonomy for the entire network based on the unified goal, planning and strategies. 9. How to evolve capabilities efficiently? It is difficult to build the mapping between ANL evaluation results and effectiveness evaluation results based on business and service objectives. It is also challenging to effectively identify weaknesses of autonomous capabilities, coordinate the autonomous capabilities of the system",

These elements are expected to help more CSPs plan and implement AN in a faster and more systematic manner. Figure 1 illustrates how the four elements fit together, and a more detailed explanation follows. Figure 1: Four key elements",
        "to AN implementation 1. Vision and target architecture – the AN vision and objectives are defined to improve business growth and operations efficiency based on the overall corporate strategy and industry trends (for example, business scenarios like computing power network). Based on the live network architecture and running status, key trends (for example, 5G-Advanced, cloud-network synergy and digital symbiosis) are considered to develop a mid- and long-term target architecture in order to guide",
        "AN construction. 2. AN Levels – CSPs must also adopt generic ANL, domain-specific ANL and the corresponding evaluation methods to fully and objectively measure the ANL. The evaluation process requires setting up baselines and identifying weaknesses to formulate phase-specific objectives and improvement strategies. Then, CSPs can launch technical research and develop innovative applications to meet the autonomous capability requirements at each level. Finally, CSPs can verify the results, optimize",
        "strategies in real time and improve resource utilization. 26 < Back to Contents | Method and practices for AN evaluation © 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 14 of 105 IG1218C Autonomous Networks Realization Studies v2.0.0 3. Effectiveness indicators – it is important to measure the business value and service effectiveness of AN in terms of service growth, customer experience and operations efficiency. The value of these indicators lies in two aspects: 1) visualizing and quantifying the effectiveness",
        "and benefits of AN evolution and 2) aligning the development of autonomous capabilities with the enterprise strategy and service development trend. Effectiveness indicators are selected based on the Zero-X and Self-X visions. Effectiveness indicators and ANL are two key AN evaluation factors that jointly facilitate the fulfillment of the AN vision. 4. Operations practices – improving autonomous capabilities for networks and operations systems is also key. From the network (including NE) perspective,",
        "the focus is on improving converged sensing, self-configuration and native intelligence. From the operations system perspective, the focus is on improving requirement translation, end-to-end resource orchestration and cross-domain O&M optimization. In order to accelerate large-scale AN deployment, the industry has summarized a five-step operations practice method for reference: a. AN implementation planning; b. ANL evaluation/weakness identification; c. strategy and direction selection; d. application",
        "innovation/pilot project verification; and e. capability development/application promotion. Organizational capabilities and industry evaluation Organizational capabilities are also a crucial factor for AN implementation. The network operations department, including the corporate culture (system), organizational structure, work processes and skills, need to be adjusted or optimized to adapt to the construction of ANs. Then industry evaluation and certification can verify the result of AN implementation.",
        "Industry organizations or authorities need to provide an evaluation environment and launch ANL evaluation and certification based on unified standards. Authoritative evaluation and certification increase credibility, help CSPs better serve industry customers and promote win-win industry development. Unified evaluation standards can help carriers improve network and service capabilities and provide customers with a Zero-X service experience. A well-founded evaluation environment facilitates innovation",

No one has definitive and detailed answers for all these [and many other] practical questions. What is clear, however, is that networks with level 5",
        "autonomy are still quite a long way off. Until they exist the AN consists of teams of humans and machines collaborating to deliver and sustain services. This collaboration is very important to secure successful business outcomes and is discussed later in this document. Telecom is not the first sector to embrace autonomy, and so it is possible to learn and infer from experiences in other sectors, such as manufacturing, automotive, and shipping (see references 1-5). Research into these learnings has",

Page 12 of 43 IG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions 4 Business Drivers The drivers for AN will vary from CSP to CSP, but fundamentally they are not so different to the drivers of any type of commercial production operation. A CSP is also a production operation, producing connectivity and connectivity related services. Using general economic theory 4 factors of production as a basis the factors",
        "of production are depicted in Figure 3. Figure 3 General economic theory: factors of production, and production model Production processes generally make use of capital and labor to convert raw materials into finished products, and inevitably there is some amount of waste which impacts profitability. Figure 4 CSP Factors of production, production model © 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 43 IG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions Applying the same logic",
        "to the CSP: the production process converts energy into ICT services, using network and IT infrastructure and the people who operate them, as depicted in Figure 4. If all of the engineered network capacity is not used, then there is also waste. These simplified production models essentially set out the main levers that an organization has to change business outcomes. They can expand their channels to market via various ecosystems, which should reduce unused capacity, but this requires the production",
        "model to transform. Many companies in manufacturing industries have already transformed by adopting technologies (e.g. industrial robots) and created highly automated flexible manufacturing engines. ANs can transform the CSP production model in the same way, increasing resource utilization and energy efficiency, and creating network services tailored to customer needs. Although all operations processes are similar in that they all transform inputs, they do differ in a number of ways, four of which,",
        "known as \"the four Vs\" according to ref[6], are particularly important: ● the volume of their output ● the variety of their output ● the variation in the demand for their output ● the degree of visibility which customers have of the creation of their output. All four dimensions have implications for the cost of creating and delivering services and products. Put simply: high volume, low variety, low variation, and low customer contact all help to keep processing costs down. Conversely, low volume,",
        "high variety, high variation, and high customer contact will generally carry a cost penalty for the operation. This is best illustrated with the \"operations typology\" chart used in ref [6], as depicted in Figure 5. Figure 5 Operations typology - the 4 Vs © 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 14 of 43 IG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions Different CSPs will have varying ambitions on each of these \"V\"s according to their business strategy, all with their own",
        "trade-offs. The AN must allow a CSP achieve the appropriate level of \"V\" for each market segment, or even partner or customer (if required). Analyzing any of the main public cloud service providers through these \"V\" prisms its evident they have designed their platform and products to: • be very high volume if required, and, critically, without a corresponding increase in cost • provide a reasonable (but not infinite) amount of variety • provide great ability to handle variations in demand (scale",
        "up, scale down) • provide acceptable visibility through the use of APIs and intelligent agents(bots) These are good baseline targets for a CSP also. An operation contributes to business strategy by achieving the following performance objectives: 1. Doing things right, resulting in a quality advantage 2. Doing things fast, resulting in a speed advantage 3. Doing things on time, resulting in a reliability (or dependability) advantage 4. Changing the things that are done, resulting in a flexibility",

        "Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions 5 Business Driver Principles Every CSP is different, and so are their precise business drivers. Thus principles 1-7 below will apply in different amounts to each customer. As described in ref [10] and ref[11] these are expressed with intent, at customer, partner, business, and service and network operational layers, and the role of the AN will be to reconcile and resolve the conflicts, both initially and on an ongoing basis.",
        "5.1 Scope Everything within the AN shall not need to be fully (or even partially) autonomous, it may not be justified from a business perspective. This is an overarching principle to remind us that its extremely unlikely (or even infeasible) that every single part of the CSP business will be fully autonomous. In fact, in some cases, too much autonomous behavior may be counterproductive, and create more issues than it resolves. Per ref[7] the performance of the human-machine system increases with",
        "the autonomy of the machine, but only until some optimum, after which it decreases. That is because if the autonomy of the machine is further increased, the human operator is likely to lose control of the situation, and performance then regresses, as shown in Figure 6 below. Figure 6 Balance of Autonomy Furthermore, excessive automation tends to lower the level of vigilance of human operators of highly automated systems, that is: the more intelligent a system is the more complacent the © 2020. All",
        "Rights Reserved. Page 16 of 43 IG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions human operator becomes - this can also be counterproductive. Thus: not every function should reach L5 autonomy. This could be revisited when industry efforts have realized systems that are getting close to L5 autonomy, this is not in the near term, however. 5.2 Customer Experience (CX) Customer experience shall, for most CSPs, be a key driving factor when considering and deciding how autonomous",
        "a function or domain should be. The focus shall be on how customer is going to experience the product (or service) provided by the network and what happens if and when it fails or degrades. 5.3 Cost of Operation Cost of sustainment (or cost to operate) shall drive the need to implement autonomous behavior. Generally, functions that are more costly and onerous to operate should be prioritized over ones that are less costly. The AN shall help the CSP deliver products and services at lower per unit",
        "costs, maximize the utilization of their assets, and minimize waste. 5.4 Speed of Operation Speed of operation shall drive the need to implement autonomous behavior. Functions that are slow, or that regularly become bottlenecks, are obvious candidates to target for some (or full) autonomy. The AN shall help the CSP reduce execution times across all tasks and disciplines: service design and creation, network rollout, service, network, and customer provisioning, assurance, billing, rating, migrations,",
        "service retirement, etc. 5.5 Reliability of Operation Reliability (or dependability) shall drive the need to implement autonomous behavior. Reliability means doing things in time so that customers receive the right set of products and services exactly when they are needed, or at least when they were promised. Over the long term being reliable translates into time and cost savings, improving the business reputation, and ultimately increasing future revenue potential. The AN shall help the CSP become",
        "more reliable. 5.6 Quality of Operation Quality is consistent conformance to customers (and partners and regulators) expectations - in other words \"doing things right\". \"Doing things right\" shall drive the need for autonomous behavior. In some way’s quality is the most visible part of what a CSP does from a customer perspective, and thus is related to guiding principle #1 because its often perceived(especially bad experience), but quality is about more than customer experience. The AN shall help",
        "the CSP deliver error-free products and services which are ‘fit for purpose’. © 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 17 of 43 IG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions 5.7 Flexibility of operation to make changes Flexibility of operation shall drive the need to implement autonomous behavior. Today customers demand greater flexibility in the following ways: • product/service flexibility – ability to introduce new or modified products and services • product/service",
        "mix flexibility – ability to produce a wide range or mix of products and services • volume flexibility – ability to change level of output or activity to support different product volumes, or capacities • delivery flexibility – ability to change the timing of delivery of services and products. The AN shall help the CSP become more flexible to customers changing needs. 5.8 Risk of Business Discontinuity Risk of business discontinuity shall drive the need to implement autonomous behavior. Business",
        "discontinuity can happen for several reasons; examples would be IT security attacks, or organizational competence gaps (e.g. due to CSP staff aging demography, or faster pace of technological change). The AN shall enable the CSP to have more robust business continuity plans and procedures. © 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 18 of 43 IG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions 6 Observability To see what is going on inside a system under observation, the system",
        "must be observable. That is: there must be measures, or metrics, produced by the system that can be monitored externally. Autonomy will be the metric used to translate to the autonomous levels mentioned in the business architecture[ref 10] and technical ref architecture[ref 11]. If, for example, a network domains autonomy is 100% (i.e. all activities are performed by a machine and no activities are performed by humans) then this would translate to autonomous level 5. While the autonomous level is",
        "informative about the system capability in terms of autonomous behavior it is not the only measure needed to ensure a successful business outcome when using an AN. In general, as a system gets more autonomous more (not less) observability data is needed to assure that everything is working correctly, and to better effect than traditional more manual methods. 3GPP observability focus has been on specific network performance indicators which, in most cases, were observed by humans. As autonomy levels",
        "increase machines will do more of these observations, and take more decisions that, ordinarily, are taken by humans today. Thus: these automated processes and the logic that drives them need to be more observable. A candidate set of observability categories are outlined below. Note that these are not fully elaborated metrics and formulae. Figure 7 Observability 6.1 Autonomy The autonomy of a system is measure of its ability to make choices and enforce its decisions. To have autonomy (or act autonomously)",
        "the system must have (1) intelligence and (2) capability, and these are both bounded, as shown in Figure 8. There is little or no value in building an extremely intelligent system that can make many choices independently if the system does not have the capability to implement the choices. © 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 43 IG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions Figure 8 Autonomy: Intelligence versus Capability To use a simple example: take the case",
        "of a robotic lawnmower. These are excellent intelligent products for flat and undulating terrain, but their capability often limits their autonomy, and therefore utility. For gardens that are split level, or non-contiguous, for example, the robotic lawnmower does not have the capability to autonomously move between one area and another - a human must intervene. The lawnmowers autonomy is therefore bounded by its capability. Thus: system autonomy is best measured as a function of what tasks and operations",
        "can be done independently, and what requires human intervention. At a very simplistic level it would be expressed as follows: ′ # 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 𝑂𝑂ℎ𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 𝑑𝑑𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 𝑂𝑂 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑟𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 ℎ𝑟𝑟𝑢𝑢𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖𝑂𝑂𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑂𝑂𝑢𝑢𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 # 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 To enable calculation of such a metric telemetry data is required • # operations (or tasks undertaken) • # operations that require human involvement • # operations that do not require human involvement These should be available over many dimensions of analysis,",
        "such as: time of day, day of week, user ID, domain, operation type, object type, attributes, object instance, vendor, software version. When SON (self-organizing networks) were introduced by 3GPP in 2010 (and appeared in commercial products subsequently) all configuration changes made by the network were logged alongside human-applied configuration changes, thus it was, in theory, possible to compute what % of configuration changes were made.

Without that trust adoption of the AN will be a significant challenge. Trust depends on mutual understanding, that is:",
        "a human must first understand the behavior of the AN before they can grow to trust it. The behavior and competence exhibited used by the AN must be appreciated by humans for it to engender trust, and this must be consistent over time. At a high level, trust can be simply defined as follows: More practically there are three dimensions to trust that must be 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶 considered: 𝑇𝑇𝑂𝑂𝑟𝑟𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂 = 𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶𝑇𝑇𝐶𝐶 Dependability: the belief that the system will do what it indicates it will do (or what",
        "business policies indicate it should do). This largely pertains to metrics that already exist for service availability, reliability, and integrity, but would also include safety (no bad consequences for users or the environment), encompassing confidentiality and security. Competence: the belief that the system has the ability to do what it indicates it will do (or what business policies indicate it should do). It can be assessed by tracking how often (or not) a human agrees with what the AN is suggesting",
        "as a course of action. Each recommended course of action should come with an explanation. Satisfaction with the explanation can be measured by collecting human feedback from the user interface. Integrity: the belief that a system is fair and just. This relates to bias, and whether the system exhibits any form of bias towards customers, customer groups, partners, etc. This bias could be explicit (attitudes or beliefs expressed at a conscious level of awareness) or implicit. Human curiosity is also",
        "something that should be considered. That is: how do users interact with explanations. This can inform us on the quality of the explanations the system is providing, and whether the mental models used within the explanations are appropriate for users. Ideally it should be possible to track • # suggestions made by AN • # user feedbacks provided on suggested made by AN (satisfactory and unsatisfactory) • # operations whose underlying logic and output can be accounted for • % operations of whose underlying",
        "logic and output can be accounted for At a deeper technical level where AI is used AI model inputs and outputs should be tracked to identity irregularities which may indicate bias within an algorithm. 6.3 Deployability Deployability is a measure of how straightforward a system is to deploy. This could be measured in terms of deployment time (i.e. how long does it take) deployment success rate (i.e. is the deployment 100% successful, or does a human have to intervene to resolve some issues). Naturally",
        "when the network is autonomous these metrics should be (1) better than today’s more traditional deployment approaches and (2) continuously improving. The following types of data would, at a minimum, be required from telemetry:- • Total time to deploy • Time deployment process had to be paused © 2020. All Rights Reserved. Page 21 of 43 IG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions • # associated work orders • # humans involved • # human operations involved 6.4 Adaptability",
        "Adaptability is a measure of how good a system is at adapting to state changes, whether caused internally, or via the external environment. Whenever major changes occur the AN will, for some amount of time, go into a state of inequilibrium, where it is no longer synchronized with the network. The goal is to return to a state of equilibrium as quickly as possible in order to remain in control. Measurements that matter are • Time in in-equilibrium: time in which the AN is adjusting to dynamic changes,",
        "and therefore is not in complete control • Time to adapt: time taken for the AN to adjust to the above mentioned changes (e.g. ML models are retrained etc.). In control theory this is called “time to reach accuracy” • Time between adaptations: time between two adaptations, indicating how robustly the autonomous system (or function) is handling incoming network data. This is akin to a term within machine learning, called 'performance drift'. Drift is about monitoring model KPIs to determine model",
        "performance, which may trigger a retraining process if drift has occurred. If incoming network data is dramatically different to the training data which the model has been created, then performance drift often will occur. 6.5 Sustainability CSPs are significant users of energy and markets generally expect them to report on their usage and how they are reducing their carbon footprint. The AN should help the operator monitor and actively reduce the power consumption and therefore CO2 emissions. The",
        "following types of KPIs are relevant: • Energy Consumption • Energy Consumption by source (Fossil fuel, nuclear, solar, wind, EV battery) • Carbon Footprint (ktons of CO2) • Water consumption (for cooling systems, where applicable) As examples two publicly quoted objectives from Telia and BT, per their annual reports:- • Telia: be Co2 neutral and zero waste by 2030 • BT: reduce Co2 emissions by 87% by 2030 6.6 Consumability One of the main customer criticisms of CSPs today is that they cannot deliver",
        "services quickly and frictionlessly like cloud service providers. In contrast products and services offered by cloud service providers are very \"consumable\" : customers can easily select what they need, configure it, and it is available for use instantly, or, in the worst case, a few minutes later.

        "solutions turned on when you need them, and off when you do not. This is where CSPs need to get to. Key consumability metrics for a CSP will be • Time to find product • Time to order • Time to service consumption • Time to customize service • Time to modify service (e.g. increase or reduce capacity, add more branch offices, etc.) • Time to cancel • Number of human interventions required, per transaction (this should be zero, or close to zero, per cloud service providers) 6.7 Resource Efficiency and",
        "Utilization These metrics are not new for ANs but are very important comparatively. An AN should do much better here than a manually operated network, otherwise the business case for AN is not as strong. 6.7.1 Resource Efficiency Many operators talk about “production cost” or “production cost-per-bit”. The more resource efficient the network the lower the production cost. CSP will want to track how good the AN is at achieving efficiency gains versus a manually operated network. The AN should be able",
        "to do more with less, e.g. if 100 CPUs costing $100K/month are needed to improve a process costing $90K/month by 15% that is not a good result! Metrics such as the following are relevant • CPU unit / MB consumed • Memory unit / MB consumed • kWH / MB consumed • <#human minutes expended> / MB consumed 6.7.2 Resource Utilization This is about understanding how good the AN is at achieving better resource utilization levels. The metrics will focus on resource utilization across CPU, memory, radio frequency.",
        "6.8 Quality of experience Similar to resource efficiency and utilizations QoE metrics are not new. The AN should deliver better customer perceived quality of experience (QoE) to all applications that use it, and it should be comparably better than a network that is manually operated.

This phenomenon should reduce with the AN based on better resource allocation policies 6.9 Observability Principles 6.9.1 Observability All components",
        "within an AN shall be observable. All domains (and functions within domains) shall produce appropriate data to support SLA monitoring • automated incident detection and alerting • analysis of system health (historical trends and analytics) • manual debugging - when necessary • “Appropriate data” includes Metrics (standardized and non-standardized performance counters), KPIs (useful for analytics), Logs (useful for behavioral understanding and problem determination purposes), Health check outputs",
        "(useful to understand health status of individual components), Tracing (useful for understanding control flow from one domain (or function) to another). Given that an AN is a heterogeneous environment interoperability in this area is important. 6.9.2 AN key performance indicators New dimensions of analysis shall be necessary to measure and evaluate the success of ANs. New KPIs shall be specified as part of standardization efforts but nominally the output shall consist of the following KPI categories:",

Simplistically: • for an L0 AN system the human carries out all activities and therefore is 100% responsible. • for an L5 AN system the network (or machine) carries out all activities and therefore is 100% responsible. Idealistic perhaps, but mathematically correct! • Most networks are somewhere between 0 and 5 and thus responsibility is shared. The challenge is the percentage of sharing in L1-L4 networks can be very dynamic, and it can be very difficult to track. The following",
        "principles are outlined to help with the creation of CSP specific situational awareness mechanisms. 7.1 Responsibilities at first startup of AN Upon the first startup of the AN autonomous functionality shall be enabled, but not activated2.

The functions and tasks that are delegated to the AN must be evident to the relevant human(s) at all times, as well as",
        "when the status changes.

        "clear • the AN shall request a confirmation that the human has accepted the handover • if no confirmation is forthcoming the AN shall take steps to secure a safe steady state (there may be some negative consequences), these steps would essentially be heuristics and predetermined rules that are appropriate to the specific scenario.

As it progresses up the autonomous levels the AN takes on more tasks and the human",
        "does less, being freed up to do more strategic work within the business. This often gives rise to the so-called “control problem” [ref 12,13], which is the tendency of the human agent within a human–machine control loop to become complacent, over-reliant or unduly diffident when faced with the outputs of a reliable autonomous system. To paraphrase it in logic: The control problem occurs when: [ Machine automation fails OR degrades to a level that is problematic ] AND [ Human does not notice OR is",
        "incapable of taking over responsibility when needed ] Note that this problem is not unique to AI or ML powered automation, it applies to any type of automation implementation. If AN is 100% reliable in terms of delivering business outcomes then human supervision is not necessary, and thus the control problem will not occur. The reality, however, is that very few automation functions are 100% reliable so some human supervision is still needed. “Almost 100% reliability” is actually the biggest issue:",
        "- Extremely high (but not 100%) reliability engenders complacency in humans, and they often switch off, which means they are not ready to take over if the machine automation encounters an insurmountable problem - because the automation is so reliable humans do not get to practice many of the normal day-to-day tasks that they performed in the past, thus they slowly become deskilled. The most important goal for the AN HMI is to secure the users correct interpretation of the network status, and that",
        "they understand their responsibilities in the moment of a responsibility transition. Based on research in other fields (military, aviation, shipping) [ref 13] the appropriate and practical ways to alleviate the control problem are - Ensure the human still has a meaningful and active role in “policing the automation”. This may [counter-intuitively] mean using less reliable technical solutions in some instances to instill greater vigilance in humans. The targeted scenarios may vary per operator, a",

The human only and machine only designations are based on who is better and more naturally suited to these items (at least currently – machines may advance in other areas in future). In summary the AN HMI should be carefully designed to consider the psychological and cognitive traits and states of humans with the goal of optimizing the human’s understanding of the current task/situation and of reducing incorrect system operation. It will not be one-size- fits-all, rather it will",
        "be self-adjusting to each CSP environment. Some related principles are outlined below: 10.1 Human-machine interface – human-agent teaming The AN HMI shall support flexible modes of human-agent teaming, whereby a human (or group of humans) and the network behave as equal partners on a team (but human intervention is still in place, obviously), and collaborate on goals where there is “shared situation awareness” within the team. Shared situation awareness is knowledge about the current state of the",
        "task environment, as well as team activities, team performance, dependencies, and overall progression with respect to the team task. Such knowledge shall facilitate coordination and reallocation of tasks within the team but shall also be used for effective and efficient communication inside and outside the team members. 10.2 \"Flight simulator\" mode As the ANs gets increasingly automated there will be less work for the user to do (in terms of traditional tasks at least). On a similar vein some parts",
        "of the network are increasingly reliable, and many error scenarios are not seen regularly, if ever! (i.e. extremely rare). The result of these situations is that humans could become deskilled over time because they are not actively doing the work as they did in the past. The AN should support \"flight simulator\" style drills in a sandbox or simulation environment to help them maintain their skills and prepare for \"chaos monkey\" scenarios that, generally speaking, would not normally be experienced.",

Page 32 of 43 IG1229 Guiding Principles for building and measuring Autonomous Network solutions 10.3 User profiles to better optimize human:machine collaboration To account for the fact that, just like the network, humans change over time (skills, abilities, connections, etc.) and better enable human collaboration the AN should build targeted profiles or annotations of users to understand",
        "their technical and operational competences, abilities, and strengths, and their workplace related “social” network. Such profiles are useful for task/work allocation, ad hoc team formation, user behavioral analysis (to build strong machine learning models, for example), and bias detection. 10.4 Human-machine interface presentation of information To [eventually] reach level 4 and 5 autonomous levels the HMI of the AN should generally only display information for which a human consultation (or decision)",
        "is necessary. Presentation of unnecessary information [for the task at hand] should be avoided as much as possible to avoid high cognitive load on the human which ultimately negatively impacts decision making. Note: this may not be achievable from the outset, but it should be a goal, and there should be a plan on how to achieve it 10.5 Human-machine interface multi-modality (AN ↔ network operator domain experts) To cater for increased customer diversity and the ongoing trend in application mobilization",
        "the AN HMI shall cater for different usage and modes of interaction. The traditional telco “big screen” model of network operations is not a suitable HMI for many enterprises, and majority of CSPs are mobilizing many of their systems.

        "This is an overarching principle to remind us that it is extremely unlikely (or even infeasibly) that, pragmatically, every single part of the CSP business will not be fully autonomous. In fact, in some cases, too much autonomous may be counterproductive, and create more issues than it resolves. Per ref [7] the performance of the human-machine system increases with the autonomy of the machine, but only until some optimum, after which it decreases. That is because if the autonomy of the machine is",
        "further increased, the human operator is likely to lose control of the situation, and things then regress, as shown on below. The following will differ in priority for each CSP depending on the type, size, and goals of the business 1 Business driver Customer experience Customer experience shall, for most CSPs, be a driving factor when considering and deciding how autonomous a function or domain should be. The focus shall be on how customer is going to experience the product (or service) provided",
        "by the network and what happens if it fails or degrades. Focusing on these scenarios shall drive out the right autonomous behaviors. 2 Business driver Cost of operation Cost of sustainment (or cost to operate) shall drive the need to implement autonomous behavior. Generally, functions that are more costly and onerous to operate should be prioritized over ones that are less costly. The AN shall help the CSP deliver products and services at lower per unit costs, maximize the utilization of their assets,",
        "and minimize waste. 3 Business driver Speed of operation Speed of operation shall drive the need to implement autonomous behavior. Functions that are slow, or that regularly become bottlenecks, are obvious candidates to target for some (or full) autonomy. The AN shall help the CSP reduce execution times across all tasks and disciplines: service design and creation, network rollout, service, network, and customer provisioning, assurance, billing, rating, migrations, service retirement, etc. 4 Business",
        "driver Reliability of operation Reliability (or dependability) shall drive the need to implement autonomous behavior. Reliability means doing things in time so that customers to receive the right set of products and services exactly when they are needed, or at least when they were promised.

Leveraging AOMM to align operations to business strategy The success of executing an organization strategy is dependent on how well the organization executes its operating",
        "model to achieve its business strategy. The operating model defines the model which includes the required business capabilities underpinning the people, process, resources and information necessary to implement the strategy. For instance, if an organization seeks the digital operating model to execute its digital transformation strategy, the question is whether there is a strong alignment between the organization capabilities, operating model and the business strategy. The AOMM will serve the purpose",
        "in the capability gaps identification and the capability blueprint formulation to prepare the operation in executing the strategy. 4.1. Objective AOMM Assessment The AOMM is introduced to provide an assessment of the organization as-is capability maturity level, set the next level target, and identify the business capability gaps. The maturity assessment is scored from both the inside-out and the outside-in view which could be from various functional teams and external consulting company. The objective",
        "for engaging multiple parties in the assessment is to assist in eliminating biasness or any possible hidden agenda. Maturity models are a common part of the transformation toolkit and are heavily used in project & process management, however research shows that they rarely result in performance improvements (Jugdev, 2002). Maturity models are characterized by check lists against paper process which probably has undergone several rounds of changes in the field without diligently updated or process",
        "models that oversimplify reality and lack quantifiable evidence (McCormack, 2009). This lack of empirical foundation results in recommendations and priorities that lack the economical foundation and the level of business justification required in telecom operators and enterprises who are looking for return of investment in months and not years. The company has agreed that they need to transform a part of the business and a transformation lead and team is established. This team will usually start",
        "by carrying out face-to-face interviews with top managers and operational managers to get some guidance. Then key individuals in the organization will be identified for data gathering through workshops, questionnaires, calls etc. In parallel with this activity the key performance indicators (KPIs) of the programme will be identified and systems teams will be engaged to start producing glide paths and other relevant information. Data driven operations with process transparency will provide obvious",
        "and clear areas of enhancement and process optimization opportunity. Furthermore, consultants may be brought into benchmark, assess and advise on the current way of working and opportunities for change which typically introduces an industry maturity model. But all too often the consultant is applying lessons learned from a commercial environment (geography, regulatory, contractual etc.) that is often far different from the current operator.  2022.

        "Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0 Therefore, when it comes to the AOMM assessment, it is imperative to have a transparent data driven process mining model in providing guidance to an objective and consistent approach in determining the AO maturity level and identifying areas of capability requirement to drive operation efficiency towards autonomy. 4.2. Process Mining Model There are four key stages behind the process mining model which will enable companies to use the model efficiently",

At the same time, the industry standard will provide the basis for further innovations, such as for expanding the scope of the system to include artificial intelligence, machine learning and then industrializing it.

The 4-stage process mining are as follows: 4.2.1. Process Discovery This technology extracts data from event logs in transactional systems that support key processes and makes it possible to understand and measure actual process flows and variations.

        "Page 46 of 61 GB1042A Objective Approach to AOMM for ANL Process Automation v1.0.0 Figure 4-2 Event Log Sample Input for process mining is an event log. A traditional event log views a process from a particular angle provided by the case notion that is used to correlate events. Each event in such an event log refers to (1) a particular process instance (called a case), (2) an activity, and (3) a timestamp. There may be additional event attributes referring to resources, people, costs, etc., but these",
        "are optional. With some effort, such data can be extracted from any information system supporting operational processes. (processmining.org, n.d.) 4.2.2. Process Analysis Process mining methodically discover event data and process models from the event logs, covert the CSV file to XES format where the process map is replayed and revealed the actual operation process flow. eXtensible Event Stream (XES) is the standard format for process mining adopted by the IEEE Task Force for logging events. During",

Process Enhancement After much analysis is done on the event",

One type of enhancement is service quality recovery, modifying the model to better reflect reality. For example, if two activities are modeled sequentially but in reality, can happen in any order, then the model may be corrected to reflect this. Extension could be another perspective of the process enhancement, for example, by using",
        "timestamps in the event log of the customer complaint handling process, the existing process model could be extended to show bottlenecks, service levels, and frequencies. To drive process automation, process models that involved long and much manual effort could be identified for process optimization, for example, introducing rules, policy and API for a closed loop automation. © 2023.

        "Prediction The process discovery can be extended with information to predict the completion time of running instances. By replaying event logs one can build predictive models, i.e., for the different states of the model particular predictions can be made. For example, a predictive model learned by replaying many cases could show that the expected time until completion after enabling is \"X\" hours. In the data-based industrial process prediction practice, there are multiple classification strategies",

For each of the characteristics of predicting modeling, there are commonly used prediction techniques which include the time series-based methods, the factor-based methods, the prediction intervals construction methods, and the granular-based long term prediction methods. In network operations,",

The question is that is there an objective approach to determine the degree of man-machine collaboration and consequently classifying the ANL the operation is at.

For the man-machine collaboration analysis, this guide will only be focusing on the common trace of the process flow and leaving the exceptional trace for non-",

Ideally, intent expresses a utility level goal that describes the properties of a satisfactory outcome rather than requiring a specific outcome. Intent is infrastructure",
        "agnostic and portable: The expectation expressed by intent originates from contracts and business strategy. It does not change if the underlying system is replaced or modified. While implementation and capability differences between system vendors will continue to exist, intent can be ported between system generations and implementations. Intent is complete: Intent defines all goals and expected behavior. If it is not specified as intent, it is not a goal the system needs to consider. This also means",

Intent is composable: Multiple intents are given to the Autonomous Networks, and it is expected to consider them altogether. Unlike traditional software systems, where requirements are analyzed offline to detect and resolve conflicts prior to implementation, intents are added during run-time. Therefore, an essential capability of an autonomous system would be to detect and resolve conflicts.",

For example, an intent that specifies a service needs to be delivered would not become invalid once the service is initially provisioned.

Intent is measurable: It uses measurable and ideally standardized",

Using closed control feedback and intent-driven interactions,",
        "we can deploy smart software to continuously monitor and optimize the networks. Autonomous Networks have become a prerequisite for many more advanced use-cases. For example, with 5G and Software-Defined Networks, often the topology of the network itself is dynamic: higher-level application services dynamically change their network requirements in the same way as cloud-computing applications elastically change their compute requirements. Autonomous Networks can enable concepts like Digital Twins that",
        "allow you to model and dynamically simulate changes to a Network to de-risk such changing requirements. Another example is for mission-critical services that require the network to be “in the loop”. An Autonomous Network can interact with the higher-level mission-critical service through APIs to warn of potential service interruptions. An autonomous vehicle could, for example, be warned about crossing an international/roaming boundary and the vehicle could adopt a limited-network mode where it drives",
        "more slowly. For industries like healthcare, aviation, and transport, Autonomous Networks must support the move from “best-effort” networks to ultra-reliable “network-in-the-loop” services.

Page 7 of 8 Autonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1 Overview One of the main drivers for automation in communications service providers’ (CSPs’) networks is the urgent need to reduce complexity so that they can lower operating costs. This is especially important as networks become software-defined and 5G is deployed. Even more importantly, CSPs must automate their networks and operations to deliver rapid service adaptation and deployment, with the dual objectives",
        "of improving customer satisfaction and increasing revenue. A new project is addressing the complex business issues surrounding both, along with solving technical challenges. Using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, CSPs are aiming to fully automate the lifecycle of the services they deliver to end customers and of internal network services, which are chains of technical components. Increasingly, both kinds of services are being delivered across a diverse ecosystem of partners that",
        "can include not only multiple CSPs but also many network component suppliers and third-party application providers. The idea is to abstract the network as a set of software services and then use intent, automated closed control loops, and machine learning to make networks and operations self-configuring, self-optimizing, self-organizing, self-healing, and self-evolving. The purpose of abstraction is not to be vague, but to create a new semantic level in which one can be absolutely precise. (E.W.",
        "Dijkstra)1 These abstractions are catalogued and explained in this document as part of an overall AN blueprint, to guide operators in the building and measuring of the autonomous capabilities in their platforms and networks.

        "govern itself or control its own affairs. A simple way to distinguish between \"autonomous\" and \"automated\" is to examine the amount of adaptation, learning, and decision-making that is integrated into the system. Automated systems typically run within a well-defined set of parameters and are very restricted in what tasks they can perform. The decisions made or actions taken by an automated system are based on predefined heuristics. Networks will evolve from simple automation to autonomic control",

The sophistication of self-management capability will also increase as these autonomy level increases, such as a progression from self-healing to self-optimization and then to self-governing abilities. Overall, the capabilities will evolve from “doing”, to “responding” and “deciding”. It is only in the decision- making cycle that the learning processes can be applied because it analyzes decisions taken and measure their effectiveness over time. 2.2 Principles",

Mundane automation work will be handed off to autonomous systems, but the business side will always need people to oversee the network and design and monitor the new generation of autonomous systems.

This approach is shown in Figure 3-7 with the following major components: • Legacy (non-AN) systems (Systems A and B) with potentially different integration APIs • Integration Adapters within AN System (proposed one per non-AN system API) • Intent Handler: A component that handles incoming intents and triggers actions (API calls) and intent calls to other AN systems (System C and D).

This is why we propose a one-to-one mapping between the non-AN system and the integration adapter.

To avoid overburdening the adapter function and to streamline flows all outbound requests from the AN system should pass through the Intent Handler unless we find use cases where that cannot be supported.

For example, during a planned outage (maintenance/upgrade scenario) we may wish to",

A topic for further investigation is how the adapters and Intent Handlers could impact the AN system as a whole.

Similarly, monitoring is required around the Actions issued by the Intent Handler (outgoing relative to AN system). This is required to ensure the AN system autonomously disconnects from non-AN systems when it cannot",

There could be issues arising from degradation in the non-AN system (e.g., incoming requests are incorrect or outgoing Actions are correct but fail at a high rate) or in the AN system (e.g., incoming requests are valid but not processed correctly or outgoing Actions badly formed). 3.7 AN Architecture Model One of the key challenges in autonomic management is the alignment of concepts and models across the industry.

In this respect, intent establishes machine-readable knowledge about goals, targets, requirements, and constraints. Intent defines what",

For autonomous networks, the Intent- interaction model is a must, not optional. The role of Intent is beyond",
        "relieving the burden of the user knowing implementation details. More importantly, it sets the autonomous system's internal goal. And the system then takes proactive actions to achieve the stated goal based on its observation of the environment. So intent is the fundamental mechanism to utilize the service of the autonomous networks. 6.1 Intent and Intent Evolution The term intent appeared in telecommunication and IT already in 2014 as “intent-driven networking” in the context of Software-defined",
        "Networks (SDN). Consequently, many early implementations of intent appeared in SDN controllers in 2015 and 2016. The early use of intent in SDN was very in a technical network context and was directly involved in selecting alternative policies. The intent was either initiating processes or it was used in branching within decision trees while provisioning and managing SDN assets. The definition of intent at the time reflected this use of intent. For example, in 2015 IETF states that intent is “An",
        "abstract, high-level policy used to operate the network.” In the meantime, the understanding of intent as a concept and its role in automation has evolved from the policy and rule’s centric view towards being a universal entity for declaring and communicating goals, requirements, and constraints. The direct link to implementation assets such as policies and processes becomes less eminent with the tendency to be explicitly excluded. Furthermore, the setting of intent is often directly linked to human",
        "expectations and choices. In this respect, IETF has presented a new definition of intent in 2020, now intent is defined to be: “A set of operational goals that a network should meet and outcomes that a network is supposed to deliver, defined in a declarative manner without specifying how to achieve or implement them.” This example shift in definition can be observed throughout literature and standardization. The speed of this transition might vary, but a common direction is very evident. In 2019",
        "a technology assessment by Ericsson research did a broad overview of usages of intent throughout the industry and academic publications. It summarized the findings in a new definition: “[…] an intent is a declaration of business goals, operational goals or states that a system should meet, without specifying how to achieve them (i.e., not prescribing events, conditions or actions).” The examples of newer definitions introduce the idea that intent is a declaration of goals independent of their implementation.",
        "Furthermore, it expands the scope of what intent describes and where it is used. Business and higher operational levels are in scope rather than just the network. © 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 51 of 52 Autonomous Networks Technical Architecture v1.1 This newer definition of intent is also in line with the description of intent presented by ETSI ZSM: “Today intent-driven systems refer to intelligent software able to understand the user goals and translate automatically into a concrete prescription",
        "of service or network configuration.” “Intent is understood to be the information of knowledge objects describing these goals.” From the perspective of the user, these goals express the expectation the user has directly with respect to the actions and behavior of the system. They might also formulate derived instrumental goals needed to fulfill human expectations. The AN project definition follows the trend visible in the evolution of the intent concept and defines intent as follows: “Intent is the",
        "formal specification of all expectations including requirements, goals, and constraints given to a technical system” This definition of intent focuses on the user perspective. The user has expectations, which are directly or indirectly expressed as goals, requirements, and constraints. This also means that the intent formalism must be capable of expressing all semantics involved when users express their expectations that are relevant for correct operation for an automated zero-touch domain. These",
        "formally modeled and common semantics allow a technical system to understand what it is expected to do. It also implies that intent is encapsulated in self-contained objects, which can be exchanged over APIs to communicate the user expectations and operational expectations. The definition also points at completeness. All expectation is formulated by intent. From the system perspective, this means that all it needs to operate and optimize against is the set of intent given to it and nothing else.",
        "6.2 Implications of Intent Intent is “specification of all expectations including requirements, goals, and constraints” that applied to “a technical system”. We further deduce that intent will apply to certain objects/entities, that will be offered as the specification of the intent interface of the “technical system”. 3GPP defines intent as “a desire to reach a certain state/position for a specific entity”. That means: • intents apply to entities. • Intent is not “doing” something, but to make something",
        "in a certain state, with a clear objective and goal. • The intent occurs on a specific working object, and the intent expresses the expectation of the state of a particular object, while the states usually consist of lifecycle status and attribute status, such as the instantiation (appearance) of a service and the maintenance of its SLA attributes.

        "Separation of Intent from Intent Handling If we define the intents as expectations on entities states, then “intent” is not a brand new concept, it has always existed, even in the days of imperative UI/API based operation. One difference is that, in the past, intent generation and implementation were all performed by human beings and not a separate process.

For example,",
        "the intent on business level could be to deliver a contracted service according to agreed functional specification and non-function requirements expressed by target KPI. On the business operations layer, this is specified by Service Level Agreements (SLA) in combination with Service Level Objectives (SLO). In order to fulfill SLA and deliver the service, the service operations layer would be involved by specifying the technical details of the service. This specification corresponds to the technical",
        "requirements of an SLA defines as Service Level Specification (SLS). The fulfillment of the service might involve orchestration and that is steered by TOSCA models. TOSCA models allow the declarative specification of all service elements, needed resources, and their dependencies and topology. This means that there are at least three different types of service-specific intent. Intent containing SLA would be connected to service contracts on the business operations layer. Intent containing SLS and",
        "the technical specifications of SLA would be used to order a service from the service operations layer with all functional and non-functional requirements. Intent containing TOSCA models would be the input to the orchestration subdomain of service operation. Service-agnostic Intent Non-service specific intents or service-agnostic intents are globally applicable rather than valid for a single service instance. They express global expectations. This can for example be minimum standards to be applied",
        "to the entire portfolio. While these intents are called non-service specific, they would therefore contribute further details of how services are operated. Furthermore, non-service specific intents can address the expected behavior of the autonomous system including for example prioritization, risk-taking, or communication with humans. Legal, regulatory and standards compliance It is important to follow legislation and regulation within the markets involved in service deliveries. Intent can explicitly",
        "ask for the legislation or standards to follow and it might differentiate by market region. The level is also a choice if it is understood as meeting defined standards or integrating certain functions. For example, the use of a minimum level of encryption as default within all network slice links can be a functional requirement of a service. Instead of defining this in every service individually, an operator might use a global intent to specify this as a minimum default security level applicable",
        "to all services. Financial gain and margin Automated contract negotiation might be used for ad-hoc contracting of service without human involvement. A system capable of doing this needs the direction of what it is expected to accept or not.

It allows us to weigh in considerations and situational conclusions, which rely on experience and",

Nevertheless, it is still possible to cover many key concerns. Ideally, they are formulated as a utility, because that would immediately create review capabilities of actions and states. Save",
        "resources The need to save resources is a typical example of a commonsense concern. It can be expressed for example by defining resource value metrics and priorities per resource types. A good metric to base the intent on can be resource utilization, because only productively used resources generate income. Avoid unwanted bias A bias such as priority for high-value customers is a welcome feature. But other unwanted biases might undermine the reputation of the operator or even break laws. Examples",
        "are social/racial/sexual preferences exhibited by the autonomous operation. The root cause can be that bias in the training data did lead to bias in the resulting ML models. Another source can be the bias that is introduced into policies from the prejudices of the developer. The operator choice would then be to use intent for setting goals that steer the sensitivity of bias detection mechanisms with respect to certain types of bias. Conflict resolution hints Intents will conflict with each other,",

One of the key building blocks of intent-driven management is the intent meta-model which helps by providing an abstract representation of the schema",
        "and rules of the intent model, irrespective of the management domain or specific management layer, and enables the extension of such a model wherever necessary, depending on the context of usage.

        "Approaches TMF Specification IG 1244A (link: TBD) gives a formal representation of the intent meta-model and its relationship with the domain-specific information model. There are many techniques used across the industry verticals and SDOs for expressing intent meta-model (or knowledge organization schemes) in a machine-readable format. In this section some of these approaches are examined and also the context under which such approaches are applied is analyzed. 1.1. Semantic Web Standards (RDF,",
        "RDFS, SKOS, OWL) from W3C Figure 1. Semantic Web Stack (Source: Idehen, Kingsley Uyi. 2017. \"Semantic Web Layer Cake Tweak, Explained.\" OpenLink Software, via Medium, July 14) These standards are a set of instruments developed by W3C for modeling semantic knowledge or linked data that enable large-scale integration of, reasoning on, the data on the web that helps to realize semantic web vision of “Web of linked data”. Some important modeling specifications in the semantic web stack that may be relevant",
        "for intent modeling are described below. Resource Description Framework (RDF): A standard format for exchange/interoperability of data. RDF is available in various serialization formats such as RDF/XML (XML based syntax), Turtle, JSON-LD, RDF/JSON, etc. In simple words, RDF is used to represent simple relationships between concepts (subject, object, predicate). © 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 10 of 11 IG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0 Simple Knowledge Organization",
        "Scheme (SKOS): is a data model representation to express controlled vocabulary (such as thesauri, classification schemes, and taxonomies) that can be exchanged between computer applications and published in a machine-readable format on the web. SKOS is primarily used for indexing, information retrieval or for navigation purposes. SKOS represents Concepts (not Classes that can be instantiated unlike in RDFS and OWL) identified with URI and grouped into a Concept Scheme. SKOS is represented using the",
        "web standard such as XML and RDF (Resource Description Format). Resource Descriptor Framework Schema (RDFS): A general-purpose language used for describing the properties and classes of the RDF resources (subject, object, predicate). RDFS serves as a base for ontologies. RDFS gives RDF more expressive vocabulary through classes, subclasses, and properties. Web Ontology Language (OWL): OWL semantic web language used to build ontologies or schema on the top of RDF datasets, describes relationships",
        "between classes and uses logic to make deductions, express constraints in relations. It can also construct new classes based on existing information. OWL is available in three levels of complexity -- Lite, Description Language (DL), and Full. OWL is based on RDF and RDFS. SKOS is an Ontology created in OWL for representing controlled vocabulary, thesauri, and taxonomies. To summarize, the above standard formats help to represent knowledge in a machine- readable format with different levels of complexity",
        "and richness of semantic information it can capture. For example, a domain level concept can be represented in a basic format like SKOS with RDF vocabulary (for subject, predicate, object representation), a set of concepts (Concept schemes,) that share characteristics and relationships can be represented using RDFS or OWL based classes, properties or individuals depending on the richness of vocabulary intended to represent the knowledge (RDFS vs OWL). 1.1.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent",
        "Meta-Modeling As stated above semantic web modeling languages are primarily used for interlinking data on the web across domains and derive semantic information (based on the metadata and the relationships) that can be used for various use cases such as web search, digital library, financial services, life sciences, etc. Leveraging the Semantic web modeling techniques defined above, intent can be modeled as simply as a hierarchical taxonomy to a more complex ontology-based knowledge graph depending",
        "on the expressive power and the reasoning complexity that can be accommodated. The following are some approaches that may be relevant for the intent meta- model. • Taxonomy/Thesauri based approach (Knowledge organization approach): Terms or concepts (vocabulary of terms) organized into hierarchical or associative manner. Less complex intent vocabulary can be represented in a SKOS format. Taxonomy/Thesauri is typically used to represent concept labels or search (the relationship between concepts for",
        "display or for web search) that can be used for lookup or translation of intent through entity categorization, key phrase extraction, etc. This may act as a base for building the ontology model. • Ontology and Knowledge graph-based approach (Knowledge representation approach): Ontology is used primarily for knowledge modeling focused on complex semantics of concepts and the relations among concepts, their properties, attributes, values, constraints, and rules. Since intent is a semantic representation",
        "of goals that express requirements and constraints, ontology based Meta-modeling can be one of the choices, which means ontology can be used as a base contract for defining intent, its © 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 11 of 12 IG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0 scope, and boundaries. Ontology based meta-modeling also enables the extension of the intent schema and reuse/reference entities from existing domain-specific information models to create a more expressive",
        "and formal intent language. A knowledge graph is a collection of interlinked entities, and the ontologies form the base schema of the graph. Refer to the discussion here on difference or relationship between the knowledge graph and ontologies. Additionally, the Enterprise Knowledge white paper explains the relation between Ontology and Knowledge graph with an example For an intent-driven system, an intent model with populated values (instances of ontology concepts or facts) can be represented as",
        "an element (semantic knowledge) of the knowledge graph. Knowledge graphs can be an enabler for an intent-driven system especially when a) AI-based algorithms are trained with the graph to derive contextualized knowledge or facts that can be used for further downstream action b) a time series indexed inventory of intents can be maintained for audit or system recovery. However, the temporality of the knowledge graphs needs to be noted, which may influence the static or transient nature and associated",
        "implementation requirements to support such characteristics. 1.2. MEF Restricted Intent DSL MEF Intent-based orchestration project (W71) focuses on “developing common, multi-vendor, interoperable, intent-based policies to support use cases, services, and standards”. There are two work items highlighted as part of the W71 specification work – a) Intent-based policies that are defined as statements that express the goals of the policy in an implementation/vendor/device-independent manner b) system",
        "architecture that supports closed-loop, black-box “intent-engine” At the time of this writing MEF, W71 is still under active development, however, the contributions related to MEF intent DSL is worth referring here for the context of this paper. The MEF DSL contribution (link, not a formal specification) focuses on a restricted intent DSL for SD-WAN service catering to the Business User. A revised scope of the MEF 71 work item also indicate the development of intent policy for SD-WAN through a separate",
        "project W85 which includes Business user DSL, Application user DSL and compiler for both. The intent DSL is expected to have the following characteristics: • captures the concepts for a particular domain or interface (for example SD-WAN, MEF LSO Cantata) , for a particular type of user (e.g., Business user, Application Developer user, etc.) • Specify concepts/goals through grammar or use of programming language to program solutions. • A Lexicon/Dictionary is used to disambiguate the intent input",
        "or derive semantic meaning from the intent input. The MEF contribution referred here gives an exemplary DSL idea for a “Skype for Business” service intent. For the MEF 71 intent engine scope there are initial thoughts shared through contributions that indicate the presence of intent compiler that leverages Lexicon to disambiguate the input and a parsing logic that recognizes named entities as well as derives semantic context. The intent parsing logic recognizes named entities in the intent and maps",
        "it to different classes of interest such as People, Locations, Organizations, and Products, etc. It further extracts semantic meaning through the mapping to classes, attributes and relationships. This kind of © 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 12 of 13 IG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0 parsing is quite similar to the natural language processing followed in modern applications. The compiled intent expression is further mapped to the DSL for a specific user or specific",
        "domain. In the exemplar SD-WAN Service intent DSL format suggested in the MEF community, the DSL schema consists of the keywords to denote the start/stop of entity definition blocks, restricted domain-specific keywords (such as SD-WAN Edges, Connectivity, etc.), a place holder for user input (or variables), and comment blocks. 1.2.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling MEF restricted DSL is simple and straightforward in its representation by defining a set of keywords for a specific",
        "domain and catering to a specific set of users that can be translated or mapped to system-level policies. However, this simplicity needs to be examined with the requirement for reusability, interoperability, and applicability across wider scenarios to avoid the proliferation of multiple variations/versions of such restricted DSLs as well as specialized DSLs to meet specific needs. Additionally, the exemplar formats suggest leverage on a Lexicon of keywords, and management of such a lexicon may be",
        "an overhead unless it is handled by a centralized authority globally. MEF 71 initial contributions also indicate an evolution from restricted DSL to an advanced ontology and lexicon-based intent expression as well as the incorporation of domain-specific information model along with the ontology. In this case, an intent compiler is used to compose the semantic context by referring to the intent ontology and the input received from the consumer in restricted natural language format. 1.3. ETSI ZSM Dynamic",
        "Service Descriptor ETSI ZSM 005 (Means of automation) gives reference to the intent-based modeling concept as one of the principles for the “means of automation”. The specification also refers to intelligent orchestration as a replacement for classic orchestration which can generate prescriptions at runtime to figure out the appropriate system state taking into consideration the current context. ETSI ZSM 011 (Intent driven autonomous networks; General Aspects) which is still in the early draft stage",
        "has a placeholder for intent meta-model which is a possible technology-agnostic meta-model that can be used for intent specification within the ZSM framework. Additionally, the draft also has a placeholder for documenting the domain-specific information models that can be used to specify the different intents to be used between the different entities. At a high-level ZSM 005 differentiates between policies and intent – policies as concrete functions to take decisions and intent as higher-level goals",
        "and benefits, further policies translate intent into concrete network setup. It is also mentioned that intent-based modeling is a synonym for goal-based policy refinement, for example, CFS with certain quality or behavior can be seen as a goal. The key difference with traditional orchestration is the presence of intent-graph - CFS object along with the behavior (policy) for composition (relationship) at runtime. The intelligent engine follows the policies to build CFS -> RFS -> Resource objects.",
        "ZSM 005 further suggests the model description needs to capture the entire semantics of the model, which in other words is called the “reason behind the model” that is used by the intelligent orchestrator to create prescriptions at runtime. While the format of such a model is not mentioned in this specification, new terminology is coined to capture the Service model and the behavior aspect which may help the intelligent orchestrator to derive the runtime prescriptions – this is referred to as Dynamic",
        "Service Descriptor (DSD). Further, it is noted that © 2021. All Rights Reserved. Page 13 of 14 IG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0 the behavior aspect of the service model is captured as policies. So essentially the DSD would compose the Service objects, relationship graph, and behavior policies. At run-time the state transition of the service objects may be governed by the behavior policies and the relationship graph may influence the creation of service hierarchies.",
        "To summarize, according to ZSM 005, DSD forms the basis for intent wherein a graph of service objects is formed, and each service object is requested by another service object and such request is made on a service object. 1.3.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling ZSM 005 and ZSM 011 tend to give a mixed view on the way intent is modeled. Both specifications do not indicate the intent meta-model format or how this can be leveraged for expressing different types of intent across",
        "domains. While ZSM005 gives a new descriptor concept (DSD) which includes packaging of behavior/semantic aspect of the model to be used by the orchestrator as well as the relationship, it still looks to be low-level detail that cannot be composed without specialized operational knowledge (especially the behavior aspect). ZSM011 is in the early draft stage and currently does not indicate a specific intent meta-modeling approach. 1.4. ETSI Generic Autonomic Networking Architecture (GANA) Intent Representation",
        "and Meta-Modeling approach The ETSI GANA Framework (ETSI TS 103 195-2) being a truly generic reference model for Autonomic Networking, Cognitive Networking and Self-Management of Networks and Services, accommodates any (meta)-modeling languages for Intents and does not restrict to a specific language for (meta)-modeling of Intents.

        "capabilities for networks and services. For example, a GANA instantiation onto a Broadband Forum (BBF) network architecture scenario and its associated management and control architecture creates a “GANA autonomicity”-enabled BBF architecture scenario (see for example ETSI TR 103 473 on GANA onto BBF architecture scenarios, one of several GANA instantiation cases).

These policies are defined as follows: • Declarative",
        "policy: a type of policy that uses statements from formal logic to describe a set of computations that need to be done without defining how to execute those computations. • Imperative policy: a type of policy that uses statements to explicitly change the state of a set of targeted objects. • Intent Policy: a type of policy that uses statements from a restricted natural language (e.g., an external DSL) to express the goals of the policy but does not specify how to accomplish those goals. Further,",
        "the ENI System Architecture specification introduces the Unified Policy Information Model which is based on MEF Policy Model that serves as a common language that enables concepts used by different policy authors to be mapped to equivalent concepts in other levels. As per this model, all types of policies are abstracted and represented in terms of policy statements and each statement is represented in terms of policy clauses. ENI gives multiple language choices for writing different types of policies:",
        "• Controlled Language: a restricted version of a language that has been engineered to meet a particular purpose. Example – a restricted form of natural languages such as English which uses a subset of grammar and vocabulary. • Domain-Specific Language: a small human-understandable language that uses a higher level of abstraction to communicate and configure software systems for a particular application domain. • General Purpose Language: a programming language used by professional programmers and",
        "developers that can address a wide variety of problems and domains. As per the ENI specification, the difference between DSL and GPL is that DSL is typically designed to be used by the non-programmers that are experts in the domain which DSL is addressing. Additionally, DSL is classified as internal vs external wherein the internal DSL does not require a specialized compiler/interpreter, whereas external DSL requires the development of own grammar that may require specialized compilers/interpreters.",
        "ENI architecture specification recommends the use of external DSL for representing intent policies for enabling non-programming users to define/use the policies. Additionally, it is recommended to define standard intent grammar specifications for intent policies. It also cautions against using controlled natural language as it requires significant effort to develop and maintain. ETSI ENI Specification ENI 008 (Intent Aware Network Automaticity) explains in detail the process of intent translation",
        "using the “intent translation” functional block as part of the Policy Management. The translation is carried out because the intent policy rule for one constituency may be quite different in structure and content compared to other constituencies. The intent translation functional block is expected to perform lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, semantic analysis, and augmentation, either parsing or compiling and, optionally, interpretation of the Intent Policy. Intent translator derives meaning",

Page 16 of 17 IG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0 At the time of this writing, there is a new work item “ENI 013 – Intent Policy Model Gap Analysis” being initiated in the ETSI ENI workstream which is expected to evaluate different methods for intent policy modeling, mostly those",
        "driven by other SDOs and also expected to provide a recommendation on way forward. 1.5.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling ETSI ENI specifications give a comprehensive view on intent management based on the intent policy, covering the variants, translation mechanism, how it may be consumed by the ENI and assisted systems, etc. There are also directions on representing the intent policy as an extension of the MEF Policy Model, however, there is a lack of clarity currently on the",
        "intent DSL or the meta-model based on which intent DSL will be developed. But from the details, it looks like the direction is to use a restricted DSL similar to the approach followed in MEF. As stated above, ENI also cautions against using a controlled natural language instead of restricted DSL due to the overhead in developing and maintaining such language. The recommendations in ENI-013 (work in progress) may provide more clarity on how an intent meta-model can be used as per the directions in",
        "the ENI specification. 1.6. 3GPP Intent Modeling Approach 3GPP TR 28.812 specification “Study on scenarios for Intent driven management services for mobile networks” describes intent-driven management concepts, scenarios, and recommendations for the way forward on standardization. One of the concepts covered in this specification is an intent expression which is a piece of information that includes the objective and related details. The specification also details the responsibility of the “intent-driven",
        "Management Service Provider” to translate the intent expression information to services, network operations, and related resource requirements. In TR 28.812 a high level representation of Intent Expression is given as a combination of <IntentDrivenAction> and <IntentDrivenObject>. Here IntentDrivenObject gives the management object information according to intent requirement, whereas IntentDrivenAction provides abstract and simplified network and operation information according to intent requirements.",
        "The IntentDrivenObject is composed of <intentDrivenObjectName> and set of <IntentDrivenObjectProperties>, similarly <IntentDrivenAction> may consist of the <IntentDrivenActionName> and set of <IntentDrivenActionProperties>. Further to the intent expression concept the 3GPP specification details the intent translation as well as dimensions of the intent-driven framework. One of the dimensions being mentioned is the Language of intent, which can be: • Native machine language: expressed in native machine",
        "languages such as computer code or binary code • Imperative: expressed in simple statements mainly describing the “How” part than the “What” • Declarative: expressed without defining the control flow • Natural: expressed in human language Furthermore, the specification also differentiates Policy-driven management and intent-driven management. Here, an intent is identified as the state where we want the entity to be and policy as the necessary step to get to this state. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.",
        "Page 17 of 18 IG1259 Study of Telecom Industry Intent Meta-Modeling Approaches v1.0.0 1.6.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling While the 3GPP 28.812 specification does not give detailed intent meta-modeling guidelines, the representation of intent expression as a combination of intent object and intent action gives some direction expected for 3GPP specific scenarios. However, expression of intent as the desired state (intent object) and abstract action on an object (intent action)",
        "gives a notion that the consumer is aware of the object state and actions on an object, i.e., this is more aligned to a restricted DSL that can be applied for specific management scenario or domain. Unlike the ETSI ZSM and ENI specifications where different flavors of policy are expressed (one of those being intent policy), in the 3GPP specification, the difference between intent-driven and policy-driven management is identified. 3GPP specification also indicates policy-driven management as an evolutionary",
        "step towards intent-driven management. The specification does not indicate how the action & objective in the intent expression may map to the policy (to drive the management entity to the desired state). In 3GPP specification 28.312 (Intent driven management services for mobile networks) which is still in the early stage (initiated during the Release 16 time frame), a placeholder section for intent categories based on management scenario types is given. This section is expected to give more details",
        "on the intent expression however, this is not available yet. 1.7. IETF Intent Classification Methodology IETF draft on Intent Classification (draft-irtf-nmrg-ibn-intent-classification) discusses the network intent, methods to classify and encode intent, and intent taxonomy among other topics. Additionally, RFC 7575 (Autonomic Networking: Definitions and Design Goals) defines intent as an abstract high-level policy used to operate a network. This IETF draft on classification also identifies two key",
        "aspects to classify intents – solutions and actors. i.e., the intent types vary based on the specific solution that it caters to – for example, Carrier Networks, DC Networks, Enterprise Networks; similarly, the intent types vary based on the actor as the actor requires different intent types based on use case and context. The IETF draft further gives an intent classification methodology to create new intent classification from scratch and intent taxonomy (covering the intent solutions, intent user",
        "types, intent types, intent scopes, network scopes, abstractions, and lifecycle) that can be used along with intent classification methodology for various solutions. 1.7.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling While the IETF draft (draft-irtf-nmrg-ibn-intent-classification) currently does not suggest any meta-modeling for intent, it gives clarity on the methodology to be used for classification of intent as well as helps to identify the key elements that constitute intent and considerations",
        "while preparing the intent for specific scenarios. The IETF draft highlights the need for different types of intents catering to different use cases and contexts depending on the solution or actor that it is being used with or other criteria being considered in the intent classification methodology.

        "use case requirement. A detailed explanation of the model construct is beyond the scope of this document. The NEMO language is built around a set of basic network models abstracting the network demand and these demands can be for network resources or network behavior. The network is composed of three basic entities - Customer Facing Node, Connection, and Service Flow. To accommodate the network behavior expected by the end-user NEMO provides two types of constructs – information acquisition and control",
        "operation. The information acquisition construct provides two methods to get information about the network – Query and notification. Similarly, to control the network NEMO supports operations that can be associated with any entity such as Node or Service Flow operation. 1.8.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling As noted above NEMO language has limited scope and is primarily used for an abstract representation of network demand. The language accommodates both the object and behavior",

A reference yang model for the NEMO language is available in draft draft-zhou-netmod-intent- nemo which can be used as a meta-model.

ONAP Intent-Based Network Proof of Concept ONAP introduced the intent-based network management capability in the Guilin Release with the implementation of the IBN proof of concept (reference), which is roughly based on the 3GPP 28.812 intent-driven management system reference architecture. The ONAP Guilin release IBN PoC showcased a vertical industry use case for smart warehouse management. The",
        "PoC introduces an intent framework which takes high-level business goal as input, converts it to necessary network configurations and applies the network changes via network automation and/or network orchestration. The framework also monitors the status of the network under control, to verify that the intent is being met and takes corrective actions when desired intent is not met. The intent framework consists of four functional blocks. • intent management: Provides a northbound interface for consumers,",
        "including intent schema and intent management • intent translation: Converts higher-level business goal to network-level configuration or orchestration request • intent decision and execution: Decides which candidate intent solution shall be executed in response to a request by a managed entity and executes the translated intent solution by sending an appropriate request to a managed entity or to another intent framework. • intent database: Stores intent schema, intent instance, and intent knowledge",
        "The ONAP IBN proof of concept uses the 3GPP recommended intent structuring format which at a high level consists of <IntentDrivenAction> and <IntentDrivenObject>.

O-RAN O-RAN WG2 Specification A1 interface- General aspects and principles defines RAN intent and different types of policy such as imperative, declarative and intent policy. The RAN intent is defined as “Expression of high-level operational or business goals to be achieved by the radio access network, allowing an operator",
        "to specify the desired SLAs that RAN needs to fulfill for all or a class of users in a given area over a period of time”. The definition of different types of policies is based on ETSI GR ENI 004. While the RAN intent definition is currently out of scope it is expected that the Non-Real Time RAN Infrastructure Controller which is part of the Service Management and Orchestration component of the O-RAN Architecture, is responsible for receiving the RAN Intent and then translate to an internal policy",
        "such as over A1 interface. But until the scope of the RAN intent and the functional capabilities are clearly defined it will be too early to speculate. 1.10.1. Context of use and relevance for Intent Meta-Modeling As explained above O-RAN currently does not provide any intent meta-model specification for RAN intent. Only the need for the RAN intent at a system level is expressed. So, it is assumed that the realization of such a RAN intent is expected to be implementation specific. From the definition",
        "of RAN intent, it is assumed that the representation of the intent is more of a Domain specific language limited to RAN domain which expresses the goal in terms of SLA and RAN needs. 1.11.

        "get measured, doesn’t get managed.” To be able to measure and manage autonomy, it is important to define metrics and performance indicators that allow understanding, tracking, and managing the relationship between “cause and effect” in alignment to the business value it accrues to an organization. Industry upgrades require companies to rethink how to measure the performance of their business. Companies who are pursuing digital transformation strategies recognize that new strategies and competitiveness",
        "demand new measurement and strategic management “systems”. Thus, a clear business objective or strategy that fails to have clear measures fails to drive a clear impact on organization performance. This means you cannot effectively and efficiently manage what is not measured. Organizations recognize the need to build capabilities for autonomous operations. AI-Closed Loop Automation, Anomaly Management, Intent Management, and Autonomous Networks etc., projects are defining and developing the technical",
        "capabilities to realize new technologies and systems, but it is challenge in the midst of many enterprises digital transformation initiatives to trace specific attribution of value returned to an investment for the business. This challenge to measure the value of autonomous operations technical initiatives and the impact on business outcome in the long term has led to the definition and development of MAMA. As increased automation focuses on priming business value, “hyperautomation”, a business driven,",
        "disciplined approach that organizations use to rapidly identify, vet and automate as many business and technology processes as possible, is a trend. It is therefore a key boardroom topic to Identify, qualify and execute “hyperautomation” strategies like AI-Closed Loop Automation, Autonomous Networks initiatives and many digital transformation strategies by bringing the right value measurement and business management tools and approach to match the business needs and aspirations, and market opportunities.",
        "This requires clarity of what is expected vs. what to do. Hyperautomation has an equally massive role in business operations. In areas like customer service, it helps automate activities that help customer support representatives to focus on much higher and complex business functions. Customer support representatives delegate complex and time-consuming tasks to automated agents, while leveraging customer data to improve future interactions. By bringing automation and autonomy together, we expect",
        "to leverage the value of both to effectively deliver unique business value. This guidebook focuses on how to realize value from automation and autonomy altogether. 1.2. Origins of MAMA Measuring And Managing Autonomy (MAMA) has origins in the Autonomous Operations theme.

        "a challenge, at best fleeting. Also, there are challenges with hyperautomation initiatives in that it is very fragmented, with approaches to automation with use of technologies being far from standardized.

Defining AO initiative This is the first step to using the MAMA framework, that is to define the",
        "autonomous operation initiatives. Initiatives describe the ambition and motivation of the business. Along with these initiatives are actions that the organization must take to achieve its business goals and objectives. In planning the AO initiative, a clear understanding of the corporate strategic objectives is critical. Strategic objectives may have different dimensions, including financial-focused objectives, customer-focused objectives, internal-focused objectives, and even learning objectives.",
        "In an example, a financial objective can be to “increase add-on sales by 40% in 2 years”, with related customer-focused objectives that require “seamless quality of service experience delivery across, say, 5 cities in a catchment area in 3 years”. The clear understanding of the strategic objectives enables identify the directly related measures and targets of the AO initiative targeted. The right Autonomous operation initiative then becomes the key investment required to achieving the organizations’",
        "strategic objective. 3.1.2. Develop business capabilities The second step is to develop the business capabilities required to deliver the measures and targets defined by the autonomous operation initiatives. Business capabilities include People, Process, Resources and Information, and represent the abilities the organization needs to have to realize business value. The value stream methodology in the MAMA framework is used in this stage to enable achieve and realize such values. By defining the sequential",
        "or parallel flow of values (or value stage), the transformation project team can then specify the value items at every stage of the value realization process that contribute to the overall business value. For the example used above, subjective and objective measures such as network reliability, quality of service and customer care satisfaction can contribute to the overall quality of experience. The related value streams can be “assuring network reliability”, “assuring customer network experience”,",
        "and “get customer care”. To realize these values, different value stream stages and supporting business capabilities are needed. Business capabilities including index modeling, risk auto-detection and evaluation, fault identification and demarcation, root cause analysis & demarcation and intent resources matching are among some of them. 3.1.3. Develop the value tree The third step is to develop the value tree using the value model. The value model is called “Value Operation Framework”, or VOF in",
        "the MAMA framework to accentuate the focus on \"operations\". The value Model is a 3-layer model as the top level are the values delivered to the stakeholders, which is generated by the value streams. The second level is measuring the outcome generated by the business capabilities. These outcomes will then aggregate to the values that the stakeholders perceived. As the same outcome generated by a business capability will not mean value to every stakeholder, the aggregation logic can be adjusted based",
        "on the actual implementation of projects as time progresses. The third level is the operational metrics that measure the efficiency and effectiveness of business capabilities. To develop the value model using VOF, please refer to the Introductory Guide IG1292 for further details. Based on the “quality of experience” example above, the top level metric may be a “customer experience index” © 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 19 of 32 GB1040 MAMA Framework Guidebook v1.0.0 composed of the “network availability",
        "and reliability”, “quality of service” and “net promotion score”. The second level business capability metrics related to network reliability and customer experience can be “expected demand not served”, or EDNS, “average time and cost for problem resolution”, “customer experience index model accuracy rate”, “auto demarcation accuracy rate” and “auto quality ticket creation rate”. For further details on EDNS, please refer to the Introductory Guide IG1294. For our example above, the third level operational",
        "metrics can be “risk auto- detection rate”, “fault identification time”, “ticket dispatching automation rate”, “fault closed-loop time”, “first call resolution rate”, “number of quality tickets”, and “service quality handling time”. 3.1.4. Assess AO behaviors and correlated business capabilities The fourth step is to assess the business behaviors and underlying business capabilities that characterize expected business outcomes. These AO behaviors and expected business outcomes must support the realization",
        "of business value based on the measures and metrics defined in the VOF. Operations behavior and related business capability dimensions are assessed based on the People, Process, Resource and Information. The assessment model, called Autonomous Operation Maturity Model, or AOMM, can provide an AO project delivery the results for evaluating the maturity by way of business capability and the resulting AO behavior. For scenarios to derive an AOMM, please refer to document GB1042B. The evaluation scope",
        "for AO and related dimension for assessing maturity level of AO- related business capabilities are work in progress. With the known business capabilities maturity and gaps from assessment results of AOMM, the project team can then develop plans to improve the business capabilities by defining the “Capability Optimization Blueprint”. The blueprint should cover improvement plans for all 4 dimensions of business capabilities, which are People, Process, Resources and Information. Detail plans for different",
        "organization units should be put in place for improvement on talent re-skilling, process improvement, application & API development and system & data integration.

Principle #2 - Identify \"where\" and \"why\" an initiative is needed. Make \"wants\" subjects of \"needs\" • When Autonomous Operations is referenced, it is more than a technology implement of an enterprise. Autonomy of a business and enterprise",
        "begins with strategy to impact operations. Technology enables realize the efficiencies of scale and scope. • Value must have an \"owner\" and related \"stakeholders\". 3.2.3. Principle #3 - Separate \"what\" from \"how\" • For the \"enterprises\" focus, the enterprise's productivity plan sets the scene for realizing value from technology investments. The enterprising means to create value lies with the value fabric, or value chain, or value stream it owns or is part of. The means to create value are critical",
        "to the enterprise and its business, and so the need to reflect investments on what makes for best engaged value contribution will be foundational. • Decompose the value fabric/ value chain/ value stream into clear business capabilities.

Identifying all the contributing and impacted business processes that fit the specific business capability",
        "positioning for the enterprise will be key to maximize value to the enterprise’s business. MAMA framework addresses business value for autonomous operations as a whole, instead of focusing on just the technology part. • Value streams and value stream stages express the journey of \"how” and must define action and context. • Business capabilities establish the how and can have multiple levels. Ensure mapping the of the business capability to the right operating unit in order to establish accountability",
        "and ownership. © 2023. All Rights Reserved. Page 21 of 32 GB1040 MAMA Framework Guidebook v1.0.0 3.2.4. Principle #4 - Decompose \"what\" with use of standardized \"hows\" • Enterprises might have various interpretations and finesse around their \"what\", but a fairly well established set of \"hows\" can be tools and best practices achieving the specificities related to their what. 3.2.5. Principle #5 - Measure \"how\", and assess \"what\" • The purpose of MAMA is to measure and manage values for autonomous",
        "operation initiatives. Values are not limited to financial values but also social values, environmental and governance values. • Measuring is relevant and critical because initiatives serve as methods or instruments to realize the enterprises business goals for certain outcomes. In an era of digital transformation, data can be engineered, generated and managed to attain numerical representations of \"how well\", \"how good\" or \"how far\". Assess to validate quality of behavior towards realizing the \"hows\".",
        "One approach is to identify high level business objective achievement around what has been achieved and what could not be achieved based on how operational business units performed. • Measuring and managing the value of AO transformation initiatives is a continuous process. Having a mechanism in place to track and govern, altogether, the ongoing effectiveness and efficiencies of an autonomous operation initiative is key to be factual about promised value. • All values and metrics defined in the VOF",
        "must be measurable. The relationship between the 3-level of values in VOF can be logical and/or mathematical. 3.2.6. Principle #6 - Automation can apply to anything done. Autonomy is a specific thing. Both must serve the interest of principle #1 • For Autonomy ambitions with use of technology, autonomous is a behavior bounded by capabilities for technology-backed operations to self-govern and self-adapt. The ability to automate these capabilities with newer and better technologies is an ambition",
        "that must serve the termed view of the enterprise - short-, mid- and long-term. • Investing and implementing autonomous operations solutions must not outweigh the interests of the enterprise and its business operation's integrity. 3.2.7. Principle #7 - Start the \"how\" small, and scale big to address \"what\" value is accrued to the end stakeholder • Business growth is not equivalent to business scaling. Enterprise business scaling is when revenue increases without substantial increase in resources.",
        "Growth refers to increasing revenue as a result of being in business. Growth expands to cover all the resources, including an increasing number of employees, number of landed facilities etc. 3.2.8. Principle #8 - Assure Business Model compatibility • Business Capability development and in-operations business models must be aligned. Consider what is “Nice to have sometime in the future” to “critical immediate necessity.” • Observations from digital transformation investments have proven time and time",

        "If we look at a network servicing 10,000,000 endpoints with say 10,000 nodes, then over the next few years it's perfectly feasible that we could see these numbers increasing by up to a factor of five. In terms of incidents per hour this would lead to an estimated 25-times increase from approximately 400 incidents per hour to as many as 10,000 incidents per hour. With this volume of transactions, it would clearly be impossible to handle them manually. As we look at autonomous networks, we are less",

Operations automation sits at the core of production",

The interactions",
        "across the different layers should be based on simple, abstract API interfaces. 5.1. Closed loops With Autonomous Networks we see clearly the need for closed loops. In the past these control loops were largely confined to a single domain (e.g. the business layer or the network layer), however to deliver the level of automation required to manage the networks of the future it will be necessary for the automatic closed loops to cross domains as indicated by the red ovals in the Figure 2, in addition",

In these scenarios for example an incident in the network will impact a service, that service could potentially have an impact on customers’ SLA, so the system will have to automatically determine if, based on the customers contract if an action must be taken. That action, determined by the SLA in the customer domain, may require a change to a service or resource in the production domain to ensure that the digital service provider continues to",
        "meet the contracted SLA. If this needs to happen during the use of, or consumption of, the service then it is likely that the change will need to be made in real time. If that is the case then the application of the change needs to be controlled automatically, without the need for human interaction, and flowing a set of pre-determined rules (possibly machine learned) or the system makes a decision on the next action (AI enabled). To facilitate this sort of control on the network from the customer",

Self-configuring and self-optimizing network elements Where a network element is physically deployed impacts its characteristics, for example, by deploying a network element in an “edge cloud” which by definition is closer to the customer will reduce the latency of the function being invoked or delivered by the network element. For response time critical functions this is a very important capability",

When the network element is deployed, those characteristics that are dependent upon the physical infrastructure must run a self-test and expose the results as part of the configuration of the network element. For example, this could involve pinging the end point of the network and measuring the response time to determine the latency characteristics. This self- configuration",
        "of the network element could also include the optimization of the network element. 5.5. Combining network elements to deliver higher level services (RFS or CFS) With the reusable components of the network it will be possible to combine elements or link elements together to build higher level services.

An alignment on Autonomous Network concepts, a shared vision and framework would help the industry to progress in a coordinated way on this important initiative.",
        "Autonomous Networks evolution, standardization, and deployment will require an industry- wide consensus and each stakeholder will need to learn how to collaborate better to create the right approach. For standards work, SDOs will need to “share early and often”, align better and avoid duplication of effort. Autonomous Networks will evolve over a longer-term timeline and real solution deployments using AI that delivers a high level of network automation (AN Level 4) are expected in the next 5 years.",
        "However, it is the next 2 years that will prove crucial to its success. Concrete, tangible elements of the AN framework, generating the initial benefits and return, will deliver partially autonomous systems. These returns when reinvesting into the initiatives will bring bigger savings and the value behind AN. Standards should move fast to prepare the conditions of interoperability and commercial deployment of these autonomous systems. 1.2 SDO Landscape Summary The challenges and opportunities of",
        "AN are significant, and no single stakeholder or SDO is capable to cover the entire end-to-end perspectives of AN. The cross- SDO, industry-level collaboration to achieve consensus of key concepts and terminologies (e.g., AN definition, framework, autonomous networks levels) and the development of key capabilities, mechanisms ,interfaces (e.g., control loops, autonomous domains, intent) is essential to the success of AN.

This framework consists of the vision and implementation methodology, which includes key elements, operation practice, and industry assessment and certification. The 4 key elements of AN Framework",
        "are: 1. Key Effectiveness Indicators. KEIs help CSPs identify what benefits they could receive by upgrading their telecommunications system with more autonomy capabilities. 2. AN Levels. Operators benefit from having a clear view on their expected maturity of their network so that they can focus on the important features they should prioritize to achieve a defined level of autonomy in their networks. 3. AN Target Architecture. The realizations of zero-touch operations using autonomous network reference",
        "architectures aims to focus solutions on the essential principles and patterns that will improve Self-X capabilities and thereby help operators to reach L3 and L4 levels of autonomy. 4. AN Map (or Navigator). The AN Map is designed to help CSPs set and decompose overall AN evolution objective from an end-to-end perspective and specify the direction and priority of capability development. These 4 elements are relatively independent and need to be further organized to form a pragmatic how-to guide",

        "achieved. The general owner of the AN work can focus on the ANF's effectiveness indicators, evaluation standards, target architecture, and the AN map, to formulate the operator's ANSP, specify the overall objective and evolution path, define the key business scope of the AN, and coordinate the work division and capability evolution pace of each system.

Central to this process is the definition and measurement of key",

AN Levels gauge the level of autonomy capability in a given operational workflow or autonomous domain. However, AN Levels do not adequately reflect the overall impact or value of an autonomous network. Hence, there is a need to establish Key Effectiveness Indicators (KEIs) to help CSPs in determining the benefits of enhancing their telecommunications system with greater autonomy capabilities. The value",
        "of these indicators lies in two aspects: 1. visualizing and quantifying the effectiveness and benefits of AN evolution, 2. and aligning the development of autonomous capabilities with the enterprise strategy and service development trend. Effectiveness indicators and AN levels are the two key AN evaluation factors that jointly facilitate the fulfillment of the Autonomous Network vision. KEIs can be used in the following three scenarios: 1. Formulating improvement objectives for AN based on KEIs.",

Indicator Framework Traditional Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are typically established in response to operational and maintenance (O&M) challenges or identified weaknesses. For instance, when there are numerous customer complaints, indicators like the complaint rate are introduced to guide teams in enhancing product quality and service processes while reducing customer grievances. However, this approach primarily addresses isolated issues and lacks comprehensive planning and",
        "target guidance. It falls short of systematically steering organizational and platform capability development. In light of this, drawing from the balanced scorecard theory, the existing Metrics framework (GB935 [10]/GB988 [11], etc.), and insights gained from operator © 2024. All Rights Reserved. Page 9 of 25 IG1218F Autonomous Networks Framework v1.1.0 autonomous network Key Effectiveness Indicator (KEI) design practices, we propose an autonomous network KEI framework centered around value propositions.",
        "The design and decomposition methodology for this framework are illustrated in the following diagram, Figure 2. Figure 2. Indicator Framework The key features of this indicator framework are outlined below: 1. Value-Centric Approach: KEIs are deliberately designed from a 'top-down' perspective, aligning with the four primary value propositions of the autonomous network. Each KEI is directly or indirectly linked to enhancing one or more of these value propositions. A corresponding set of effectiveness",
        "indicators is established for each recognized value proposition, facilitating effective measurement of the value delivered. 2. Multi-Level Hierarchical Structure: The KEIs are structured hierarchically, systematically breaking down the measurement levels based on the identified value propositions. This hierarchical structure forms a causal indicator tree. The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) reflects the main AN value propositions, offering a holistic view of AN's impact at both the company and",
        "industry levels. Simultaneously, it provides guidance on achieving effectiveness and establishes internal appraisal requirements. Within each domain, detailed KPI rules can be formulated, and specific targets can be set based on the domain's unique KPIs and specialized areas of business. Furthermore, Key Capability Metrics (KCMs) can be further subdivided, driven by an analysis of process activities and identified capability gaps during the AN journey within valuable scenarios. This sub-level decomposition",
        "guides the development of system capabilities more effectively. The distinction between Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Key Capability Indicators (KCMs) lies in their respective purposes. KPIs are business-oriented KEIs that focus on end-to-end outcomes, while KCMs serve as capability measures aimed at bolstering the attainment of Key Effectiveness Indicators (KEIs) by addressing specific process activity weaknesses. In essence, KEIs measure the achievement of business objectives, while KCMs",
        "gauge key © 2024. All Rights Reserved. Page 10 of 25 IG1218F Autonomous Networks Framework v1.1.0 capabilities. As technology and capabilities evolve, the essential KCMs within a process may undergo changes, whereas KEIs tend to remain relatively stable. For instance, consider a troubleshooting scenario within a domain where the KEI is the average troubleshooting duration. At present, accurately identifying faults poses a challenge. Therefore, a suitable KCM can be defined as 'Fault Identification",
        "Accuracy.' As fault identification capabilities improve, the key weakness may shift to fault diagnosis. Accordingly, KCMs can be redefined as 'Automatic Fault Diagnosis Rate' and 'Fault Diagnosis Accuracy Rate' to address this evolving capability requirement. 3. Consider both benefit and efficiency: When defining KEIs, it is important to consider not only efficiency indicators like automation rates but also business benefit indicators such as time consumption and quality. By incorporating both benefit",
        "and efficiency aspects, a more comprehensive measurement system for KEIs can be developed. For example, in troubleshooting scenarios, it's essential to define not just the efficiency indicator of troubleshooting automation rates but also the benefit indicator of average troubleshooting duration. 2.1.2. KEI Reference Set For details about the reference set of effectiveness indicators and the definition of specific indicators, see IG1256 Autonomous Network Effectiveness Indicators [4]. The following",

Executing digital transformation strategies to grow business continues to actively explore methods to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of management and operations capabilities. Measuring and improving, as part of management of organizational capabilities, processes and/or targeted outcomes is a significant undertaking",
        "amidst the growing complexity in technology, sophisticated expectations of customers and the skills required to bring it altogether. Enterprises are inundated with many assessment and maturity models, and where a model is applied voluntarily towards evaluation of performance, enterprises aren't confident how to match assessment outcomes with business value.

Also, the proposition of specific models is key for organizations that are advanced and seeking assessment tools that offer surgical treatment of specific identified capability concerns. Autonomous Operations Maturity Model (AOMM) brings a unique approach to performance assessment by applying a maturity grid assessment framework that is underscored by the 's DMM, as well as input from other capability assessment models. AOMM maturity grid assessment framework uses",

This covers the redesigning of operations to leverage AI (at scale), self-healing network domains, and the operating models emerging with the advent of 5G, Cloud, AI and Edge Computing. The rapid evolution in management and operations practices is trickling down to service engagement and operating models. Past successes and lessons learned",
        "from managing operations since the era of assisted operations, through managed services to end-to-end full outsourcing engagement, it is clear, where adaptability and governance lacked sound basis, these engagements failed.
